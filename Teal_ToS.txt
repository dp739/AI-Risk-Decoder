‍

Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Teal in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Teal agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the expiration or termination of theseTerms.

‍

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT,BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TEAL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO ATRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND TEAL UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE OPT OUT SECTION BELOW.

‍

Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Teal will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Teal.

‍

Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period ("Notice"). Teal's email address for Notice is hello@tealhq.com. The Notice must: (1)describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific relief sought; and (3) if you are sending the Notice to Teal, include your name and address ("Demand"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or Teal may commence an arbitration proceeding.

‍

Fees; Location. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Teal will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Miami, Florida, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.

‍

No Class Actions. YOUAND TEAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2698 ETSEQ. WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION). Unless both you and Teal agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

‍

Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Teal makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Teal's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Teal's address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Teal.

‍

Enforceability. If theNo Class Actions section is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section will be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the Governing Law section will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.

‍

Opt Out. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Dispute Resolution section, you may opt out by notifying Teal in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days of the date you receive these Terms, an email to hello@tealhq.com, stating clearly your full name, address, and intent to opt out of this Dispute Resolution section. Should you choose not to opt out within the 30-day period, you and Teal will be bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution section.
