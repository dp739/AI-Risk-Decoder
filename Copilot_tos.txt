Welcome to Copilot, your personal AI companion!

These Terms explain how you can use Copilot. By using Copilot, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before you start using Copilot.

WHEN & WHERE THESE TERMS APPLY
These Terms apply to your use of “Copilot,” which includes:

The standalone Copilot apps on your computer or mobile device
The Copilot service we offer at copilot.microsoft.com, copilot.com and copilot.ai
Conversations you have with Copilot through other Microsoft apps and websites
Conversations you have with Copilot through third-party apps and platforms
Other Copilot-branded apps and services that link to these Terms
These Terms don’t apply to Microsoft 365 Copilot apps or services unless that specific app or service says that these Terms apply.

DEFINITIONS
Certain words and phrases we use in these Terms have a particular meaning:

Words like “you”, “your” and “yours” mean you, the person accessing and using Copilot.
Words like “we”, “us”, and “our” means Microsoft, the company that offers Copilot, as well as the related companies we own or control and the companies and people that work on our behalf.
A “Prompt” is the content – text, audio, images, files, voice, or video – that you send to or share with Copilot.
A “Response” is the content that Copilot sends to or shares with you. Some Responses might include “Creations” – original content or works of art that Copilot creates in response to your Prompts.
“Your Content” means the Prompts and Responses that are part of your conversations with Copilot, but it doesn’t include any content we separately own (like Xbox gaming clips, for example).
“Actions” refers to the automated set of tasks that Copilot takes on your behalf at your request.
“Services” is defined in the Microsoft Services Agreement. Copilot is a Service under that Agreement.
WHO CAN USE COPILOT
You need to be old enough to use Copilot – usually at least 13, but sometimes 18 or older, depending on your country’s laws. Because laws vary by country, Copilot isn’t available everywhere.

If you’re under 18, or if you use Copilot without logging in, we might turn off or limit some features for legal or safety reasons. If we ask for your birthday and country when you sign up or log in, you must give us your real information.

Don’t use tools or computer programs (like bots or scrapers) to access Copilot. You can only use Copilot for your own personal use.

HOW YOU USE COPILOT
Copilot is an AI-powered conversational service. Copilot will generate Responses to Prompts you submit and may also offer you Responses directly in your ongoing conversations or for things you have asked Copilot to remember.

Copilot tries to give you good answers, but it can make mistakes. Sometimes, the sources Copilot uses may not be reliable, relevant, or accurate and sometimes, Copilot may give you wrong information. When responding, Copilot may use information it finds on the internet and we don’t control that content. You might see Responses that seem convincing but are incomplete, inaccurate, or inappropriate.

Always use your judgment and check the information you get from Copilot before you make decisions or act. If you see something wrong or inappropriate from Copilot, use the Report or Feedback features in Copilot to let us know. If you have a legal concern about something Copilot says, please use the Report a Concern page to tell us.

Because of the way Copilot works, the Responses you get from Copilot may not be unique to you. Copilot may give the same or similar Responses and Creations to Microsoft, or to other people. Other people may send similar Prompts as yours and they could get the same, similar, or different Responses and Creations.

By using Copilot, you’re telling us that:

You’ve read, understood and agree to these Terms and will abide by the Code of Conduct (below).
You’ll use Copilot only in lawful ways and in compliance with all applicable laws.
You won’t use Copilot to violate our or anyone else’s rights.

Don’t damage our ability to provide Copilot to you and others. Don’t use bots or scrapers and don’t engage in technical attacks, excess usage, prompt-based manipulation, “jail breaking” and other abuses.
Don’t violate the privacy of others. Don’t use Copilot to help violate the privacy of others, including sharing their private information (e.g. “doxing”). Don’t use Copilot to infer sensitive information about others, like a person's race, political opinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, or sexual orientation. Don’t try to use Copilot for facial identification, to collect or process someone else’s sensitive personal data, or to try to verify someone’s identity. Don’t share or capture images, video, audio, or other content that includes other people without their consent and don’t try to use Copilot to process someone else’s biometric identifiers or information.
Don’t use Copilot to trick, lie to, or cheat others. Don’t use Copilot to help mislead or deceive people. Don’t use Copilot to create or share disinformation or content that will be used to impersonate, defraud, or deceive others.

Don’t use Copilot to create or share adult content, violence or gore, hateful content, terrorism and violent extremist content, glorification of violence or suicide, child sexual exploitation or abuse material, or content that is otherwise disturbing or offensive. Don’t use Copilot to create or edit images, voice, or video of other people (e.g. “deepfakes”) without their permission.
Don’t do anything illegal. Don’t use Copilot to break the law, or to help or encourage others to break the law.
If you see something wrong or inappropriate from Copilot, use the Report or Feedback features in Copilot to let us know. If you have a legal concern about something Copilot says, please use the Report a Concern page to tell us.

We may block, restrict, or remove your Prompts or other content from you that violates these Terms, or that could lead Copilot to create a Response that violates these Terms.

OUR DECISIONS ABOUT COPILOT
We may choose to limit or stop offering or supporting Copilot or any feature within Copilot at any time and for any reason.

Unless prohibited by law, we may limit, suspend, or permanently revoke your access to or use of Copilot (and potentially all other Services) in our sole discretion, at any time and without notice. Some of the reasons we might do this, for example, is if you breach these Terms or violate the Code of Conduct, if we suspect you’re engaged in fraudulent or illegal activity, or if your Microsoft Account or the account you use to log in to Copilot is suspended or closed. If you feel your access has been restricted by mistake, you may ask us to reevaluate our decision by submitting a request using the Report a Concern form outlining what you think we got wrong and why.

SHOPPING EXPERIENCES
Depending on your location and other factors, we may offer you the opportunity to browse, shop and buy certain products through Copilot. If you use Copilot to buy something, it’s sold and shipped by a third party (“Merchant”), not by us. We don’t process payments for your purchases through Copilot.

Anything you buy with Copilot is subject to the Merchant’s terms and conditions (including pricing, fees, and shipping, cancellation and refund policies). You are responsible for reading and complying with the Merchant’s terms that apply to your purchase, including how the Merchant collects and uses your personal information under its privacy policy.
We aren’t responsible or liable for any dispute between you and the Merchant about your purchase. If you have any disputes or questions about any product you purchase through Copilot, you must address it directly with the Merchant. If you have disputes or questions about your payment for the product, you must address it with your payment issuer, bank, or wallet provider.
We collect, store, use and share your personal information, including your payment information and purchases you make, in accordance with the Microsoft Privacy Statement. You authorise each Merchant to share with us information about you and your purchase and for us to send information (including your personal information and transaction details) to the Merchant, the Merchant’s payment processor, our payment processor, or other third party necessary to complete your purchase.
IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES & WARNINGS
Copilot may include advertising.
Copilot may include both automated and manual (human) processing of data. You shouldn’t share any information with Copilot that you don’t want us to review.
We plan to continue to develop and improve Copilot, but we make no guarantees or promises about how Copilot will operate or that it will operate as intended.
Sometimes, we may offer certain features or services as part of “Copilot Labs.” These features and services are highly experimental and may not always work as intended. We may add, modify, or remove features or services from Copilot Labs at any time for any reason.
We may limit the speed or performance of Copilot as we think necessary.
When you request that Copilot take Actions on your behalf, you are solely responsible for those Actions and any results or consequences.
Copilot is for entertainment purposes only. It can make mistakes and it may not work as intended. Don’t rely on Copilot for important advice. Use Copilot at your own risk.
WITHOUT LIMITING SECTION 12 OF THE MICROSOFT SERVICES AGREEMENT IN ANY WAY, BUT FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY, WE DO NOT MAKE ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION OF ANY KIND ABOUT COPILOT. For example, we can’t promise that any Copilot’s Responses won’t infringe someone else’s rights (like their copyrights, trademarks, or rights of privacy) or defame them. You are solely responsible if you choose to publish or share Copilot’s Responses publicly or with any other person.
You agree to indemnify us and hold us harmless (including our affiliates, employees and any other agents) from and against any claims, losses and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to your use of Copilot, including without limitation your use, sharing, or publication of any Prompt, Responses, or Creations, or your breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.
You may stop using Copilot at any time. If you want to close your Microsoft Account, please see the Microsoft Services Agreement.
OWNERSHIP OF CONTENT
We don’t own Your Content, but we may use Your Content to operate Copilot and improve it. By using Copilot, you grant us permission to use Your Content, which means we can copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, edit, translate and reformat it and we can give those same rights to others who work on our behalf.

We get to decide whether to use Your Content and we don’t have to pay you, ask your permission, or tell you when we do. But that doesn’t mean we can use it however we want. The Microsoft Privacy Statement explains how we use Your Content and the privacy options in Copilot give you control over some of those uses.

We can decide to remove or stop using Your Content at any time for any reason. By sharing Your Content with Copilot, you promise us that you have all rights to Your Content and that if we use Your Content, we won’t be violating someone else’s rights.

Although our Terms grant you permission to use Copilot, we are not granting you any rights in the underlying technology, intellectual property, or data that makes up Copilot.

OTHER TERMS & AGREEMENTS
By agreeing to these Terms, you’re also agreeing to the Microsoft Services Agreement, a legal agreement between you and us that applies to your use of our Services (including Copilot). If you have a Microsoft account, you already agreed to the Microsoft Services Agreement when you first created a Microsoft account.
Even if you don’t have a Microsoft Account – for example, if you’re using Copilot without logging in, or if you log in to Copilot using a non-Microsoft account – you’re still agreeing to the Microsoft Services Agreement by using Copilot. Please make sure you review it carefully.
If you use Copilot to create images, you’re also agreeing to the Image Creator Terms.
If you use Gaming Copilot or other AI-powered experiences provided in connection with any Xbox Services, you are also subject to the Xbox Community Standards.
Copilot may be integrated into other products and services we separately license to you. For example, Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal subscriptions are separately licensed under the terms at https://www.microsoft.com/useterms.
If any of the language in those other agreements conflicts with the language in these Terms, the language in these Terms controls.
When you use Copilot, you are subject to the Microsoft Privacy Statement, which describes how we collect, use and share information relating to your use of Copilot.
