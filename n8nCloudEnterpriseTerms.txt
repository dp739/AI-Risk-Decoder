The Supplier makes no representation, warranty or commitment and shall have no liability or obligation whatsoever in relation to the content or use of, or correspondence with, any such third-party website, or any transactions completed, and any contract entered into by the Customer, with any such third party. Any contract entered into and any transaction completed via any third-party website is between the Customer and the relevant third party, and not the Supplier. The Supplier recommends that the Customer refers to the third party's website terms and conditions and privacy policy prior to using the relevant third-party website.

6. Fees
6.1 The Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Fees on signature of the Order Form. The Fees are payable in full every 12 months in advance, via bank transfer within net 15 days of date of invoice.

6.2 The Customer is responsible for all taxes other than Supplier’s income tax. Fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, or duties imposed by any governmental authority (“Taxes”). If Supplier has a legal obligation to collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible, Supplier will invoice Customer for those amounts unless Customer provides a valid tax exemption certificate.

provided that if the Supplier modifies or replaces the Software, the modified or replacement Software must comply with the warranties contained in 8.1 and the Customer shall have the same rights in respect thereof as it would have had under those clauses had the references to the date of this Agreement been references to the date on which such modification or replacement was made.

11.5 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, 11.2 shall not apply to the extent that any claim or action referred to in that clause arises directly or indirectly through the possession or use of any third-party software or through the breach of any third-party additional terms by the Customer.
