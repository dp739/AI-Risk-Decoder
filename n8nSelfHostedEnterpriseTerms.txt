3.1 Subject to full payment of the applicable Fee, and in consideration of the parties’ mutual obligations under this Agreement, n8n grants to the Customer a non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable and limited licence for the Term and any subsequent Renewal Term to use the Software in accordance with the terms herein and any applicable Order Form.

3.2 In relation to scope of use:
(a) for the purposes of clause 3.1, use of the Software shall be restricted to use of the Software in object code form for the purpose of processing the Customer's data for the normal business purposes of the Customer (which shall not include allowing the use of the Software by, or for the benefit of, any person other than an employee of the Customer).
(b) the Customer may not use the Software other than as specified in the Order Form without the prior written consent of the Supplier, and the Customer acknowledges that additional fees may be payable on any change of use approved by the Supplier.
(c) except as expressly stated in this Agreement or as permitted under applicable law, the Customer has no right (and shall not permit any third party) to copy, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, adapt or make error corrections to the Software in whole or in part except to the extent that any reduction of the Software to human readable form (whether by reverse engineering, decompilation or disassembly) is necessary for the purposes of integrating the operation of the Software with the operation of other software or systems used by the Customer, unless the Supplier is prepared to carry out such action at a reasonable commercial fee or has provided the information necessary to achieve such integration within a reasonable period, and the Customer shall request the Supplier to carry out such action or to provide such information (and shall meet the Supplier's reasonable costs in providing that information) before undertaking any such reduction.
(d) the third-party software listed at this URL: https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/blob/master/packages/cli/package.json shall be deemed to be incorporated within the Software for the purposes of this licence (except where expressly provided to the contrary) and use of the third-party software shall be subject to the third-party additional terms.

3.3 The Customer may not use any such information provided by the Supplier or obtained by the Customer during any such reduction permitted under clause 3.2(c) to create any software whose expression is substantially similar to that of the Software nor use such information in any manner which would be restricted by any copyright subsisting in it.

3.4 The Customer shall not:
(a) sub-license, assign or novate the benefit or burden of this licence in whole or in part;
(b) allow the Software to become the subject of any charge, lien or encumbrance; and
(c) deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this agreement,
without the prior written consent of the Supplier, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

3.5 The Supplier may at any time sub-license, assign, novate, charge or deal in any other manner with any or all of its rights and obligations under this licence, provided it gives written notice to the Customer.

3.6 Each party confirms it is acting on its own behalf and not for the benefit of any other person.

3.7 Notwithstanding clause 3.4, a party assigning any or all of its rights under this agreement may disclose to a proposed assignee any information in its possession that relates to this agreement or its subject matter, the negotiations relating to it and the other party which is necessary to disclose for the purposes of the proposed assignment, provided that no disclosure pursuant to this clause 3.7 shall be made until notice of the identity of the proposed assignee has been given to the other party.

3.8 The Customer shall:
(a) notify the Supplier as soon as it becomes aware of any unauthorized use of the Software by any person;
(b) pay, for broadening the scope of the licences granted under this licence to cover the unauthorized use, an amount equal to the fees which the Supplier would have levied (in accordance with its normal commercial terms then current) had it licensed any such unauthorised use on the date when such use commenced.

4. New releases
The Supplier will provide the Customer with all New Releases generally made available to its customers, which may include bug fixes, enhancements and security updates. New Releases will not materially decrease the overall functionality of the Software. The Customer acknowledges and agrees to install New Releases as soon as reasonably practicable after its release. Failure to promptly implement these updates may result in the Software having unresolved bugs and/or being susceptible to security vulnerabilities. In such cases, the Supplier provides no warranties or guarantees regarding the performance, security, or stability of outdated software versions and disclaims all liability for any issues that may arise as a result.

5. Fees
5.1 The Customer shall pay to the Supplier the Fees on signature of this Agreement. The Fees are payable in full every 12 months in advance, via bank transfer within net 15 days of date of invoice. Unless a specific format is required by applicable law, invoices will be issued by email in standard electronic format (PDF or legally compliant electronic equivalent) to the Customer billing contact specified in the Order Form, to the exclusion of any Customer procurement portals or third-party invoicing systems.

5.2 The Customer is responsible for all taxes other than Supplier’s income tax. Fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, or duties imposed by any governmental authority (“Taxes”). If Supplier has a legal obligation to collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible, Supplier will invoice Customer for those amounts unless Customer provides a valid tax exemption certificate. If Customer is required by law to withhold Taxes from payments to Supplier, Customer shall gross up the payment so Supplier receives the full contracted Fees net of withholding Taxes.

5.3 If the Customer fails to make any payment due to the Supplier under this agreement by the due date for payment, then the Customer shall pay interest on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% per annum above the European Central Bank’s base rate from time to time. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment. The Customer shall pay the interest together with the overdue amount.

5.4 Supplier may suspend or terminate Customer's access to the Services if: (a) Customer fails to pay undisputed Fees within 10 days after written notice of non-payment; or (b) Customer's use violates these Terms or applicable law, or risks harm to other customers or the Services' security or integrity. Supplier will provide advance notice where practicable. If Supplier acts without cause, Supplier will refund prepaid, unused Fees on a prorated basis. No refund is owed for suspension or termination for cause. Upon resolution, Supplier will promptly restore access.

6. Confidentiality and publicity
6.1 Each party undertakes that it shall not at any time during this agreement, and for a period of two years after termination of this agreement, disclose to any person any confidential information concerning the business, assets, affairs, customers, clients or suppliers of the other party or of any member of the group of companies to which the other party belongs, except as permitted by clause 6.2.

6.2 Each party may disclose the other party's confidential information:
(a) to its employees, officers, representatives, contractors, subcontractors or advisers who need to know such information for the purposes of exercising the party's rights or carrying out its obligations under or in connection with this agreement. Each party shall ensure that its employees, officers, representatives, contractors, subcontractors or advisers to whom it discloses the other party's confidential information comply with this clause 6; and
(b) as may be required by law, a court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental or regulatory authority.

6.3 No party shall use any other party's confidential information for any purpose other than to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under or in connection with this agreement.

6.4 No party shall make, or permit any person to make, any public announcement concerning this agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by law, any governmental or regulatory authority (including, without limitation, any relevant securities exchange), any court or other authority of competent jurisdiction.

6.5 n8n shall be entitled to use the Customer’s name and logo on its sales, marketing and PR material (including website) for the duration of this Agreement and Customer grants n8n a non-exclusive license solely for this purpose.

7. Export
7.1 Neither party shall export, directly or indirectly, any technical data acquired from the other party under this agreement (or any products, including software, incorporating any such data) in breach of any applicable laws or regulations (“Export Control Laws”), including United States export laws and regulations, to any country for which the government or any agency thereof at the time of export requires an export licence or other governmental approval without first obtaining such licence or approval.

7.2 Each party undertakes:
(a) contractually to oblige any third party to whom it discloses or transfers any such data or products to make an undertaking to it in similar terms to the one set out above; and
(b) if requested, to provide the other party with any reasonable assistance, at the reasonable cost of the other party, to enable it to perform any activity required by any competent government or agency in any relevant jurisdiction for the purpose of compliance with any Export Control Laws.

8. Limited warranties
8.1 The Supplier warrants that:
(a) It has the right to enter into this Agreement and to provide the Software as contemplated by this Agreement; and
(b) the Software shall, under normal operating conditions, substantially conform to the functionality described in documentation stated in the Order Form or, in the absence of a Order Form, as described on n8n’s website (which may be updated from time to time).

8.2 The Supplier does not warrant that the use of the Software will be uninterrupted or error-free.

8.3 The Customer accepts responsibility for the selection of the Software to achieve its intended results and acknowledges that the Software has not been developed to meet the individual requirements of the Customer.

8.4 The Customer acknowledges that the warranties in clause 8.1 do not apply to any Open-Source Software incorporated in the n8n Software or as otherwise provided by the Supplier. Such Open-Source Software is provided "as is" and expressly subject to the disclaimer in clause 8.6.

8.5 The Customer warrants that they will comply with all applicable laws, regulations and codes of conduct in their use of the goods or services provided by the Supplier.

8.6 The Software is provided “as is” and “as available” to the fullest extent permitted by law. All other conditions, warranties or other terms which might have effect between the parties or be implied or incorporated into this agreement or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded, including the implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care. Supplier does not warrant that the Software provided under this Agreement will operate without interruption or be error free or that the Software or any services or documentation will succeed in resolving any problem.

9. Limits of liability
9.1 Except as expressly stated in clause 9.2:
(a) Exclusion of Damages. Under no circumstances, and under no legal theory (whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability, warranty, or any other theory of liability), will the Parties, their Affiliates and or their contractors, employees, agents, be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages (including loss of profits, data, or use or cost of cover) arising out of or relating to these Terms or the use of or the inability to use the Software, even where the Parties have been informed of the possibility of such damage.
(b) Liability Cap. The total liability of the Supplier, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise and whether in connection with this Agreement or any collateral contract, shall in no circumstances exceed the Subscription Fees paid or payable by Customer to Supplier during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the events giving rise to the claim.
(c) Customer agrees that, in entering into this agreement, either it did not rely on any representations (whether written or oral) of any kind or of any person other than those expressly set out in this agreement or (if it did rely on any representations, whether written or oral, not expressly set out in this agreement) that it shall have no remedy in respect of such representations and (in either case) the Supplier shall have no liability in any circumstances otherwise than in accordance with the express terms of this agreement.

9.2 The exclusions in clauses 8.6 and 9.1 shall apply to the fullest extent permissible at law, but the Supplier does not exclude liability for:
(a) death or personal injury caused by the negligence of the Supplier, its officers, employees, contractors or agents;
(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or
(c) any other liability which may not be excluded by law.

9.3 All dates supplied by the Supplier for the delivery of the Software shall be treated as approximate only. The Supplier shall not in any circumstances be liable for any loss or damage arising from any delay in delivery beyond such approximate dates.

9.4 All references to "the Supplier" in this 9 shall, for the purposes of this clause and clause 20 only, be treated as including all employees, subcontractors and suppliers of the Supplier and its Affiliates, all of whom shall have the benefit of the exclusions and limitations of liability set out in this clause, in accordance with clause 20.

10. Intellectual property rights
10.1 The Customer acknowledges that all Intellectual Property Rights in the Software and any New Releases belong and shall belong to the Supplier or the relevant third-party owners (as the case may be), and the Customer shall have no rights in or to the Software other than the right to use it in accordance with the terms of this agreement.

10.2 The Supplier undertakes at its own expense to defend the Customer or, at its option, settle any claim or action brought against the Customer alleging that the possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this agreement infringes the US, UK or EU Intellectual Property Rights of a third party (Claim) and shall be responsible for any reasonable losses, damages, costs (including legal fees) and expenses incurred by or awarded against the Customer as a result of or in connection with any such Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, 10.2 shall not apply where the Claim in question is attributable to possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) by the Customer other than in accordance with the terms of this agreement, use of the Software in combination with any hardware or software not supplied or specified by the Supplier if the infringement would have been avoided by the use of the Software not so combined, or use of a non-current release of the Software.

10.3 If any third party makes a Claim, or notifies an intention to make a Claim against the Customer, the Supplier's obligations under 10.2 are conditional on the Customer:
(a) as soon as reasonably practicable, giving written notice of the Claim to the Supplier, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable detail;
(b) not making any admission of liability, agreement or compromise in relation to the Claim without the prior written consent of the Supplier (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed);
(c) giving the Supplier and its professional advisers access at reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to its premises and its officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within the power or control of the Customer, so as to enable the Supplier and its professional advisers to examine them and to take copies (at the Supplier's expense) for the purpose of assessing the Claim; and
(d) subject to the Supplier providing security to the Customer to the Customer's reasonable satisfaction against any claim, liability, costs, expenses, damages or losses which may be incurred, taking such action as the Supplier may reasonably request to avoid, dispute, compromise or defend the Claim.

10.4 If any Claim is made, or in the Supplier's reasonable opinion is likely to be made, against the Customer, the Supplier may at its sole option and expense:
(a) procure for the Customer the right to continue to use the Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
(b) modify the Software so that it ceases to be infringing;
(c) replace the Software with non-infringing software; or
(d) terminate this agreement immediately by notice in writing to the Customer and refund any of the Fee paid by the Customer as at the date of termination (less a reasonable sum in respect of the Customer's use of the Software to the date of termination) on return of the Software and all copies thereof,
provided that if the Supplier modifies or replaces the Software, the modified or replacement Software must comply with the warranties contained in 8.1 and the Customer shall have the same rights in respect thereof as it would have had under those clauses had the references to the date of this agreement been references to the date on which such modification or replacement was made.

10.5 Notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement, 10.2 shall not apply to the extent that any claim or action referred to in that clause arises directly or indirectly through the possession or use of any third-party software or through the breach of any third-party additional terms by the Customer.

10.6 This 10 constitutes the Customer's exclusive remedy and the Supplier's only liability in respect of Claims and, for the avoidance of doubt, is subject to 9.1.

11. User and performance data
11.1 Unless the Customer opts out, n8n may from time to time use and process data about the Customer’s use of the Software for the purposes of creating statistics and analytics data. n8n may use such data for its own business purposes, including to maintain and improve the Software and other services and to monitor and analyse its activities in connection with the performance of such services.

11.2 To the extent n8n processes any Customer personal data, n8n and the Customer acknowledge that the Customer acts as a data controller and n8n is the data processor processing personal data together with its subprocessors on behalf of the Customer for the purpose of providing the services. All such processing of the Customer’s personal data by n8n shall be subject to the data processing agreement found at https://n8n.io/legal/data-processing-agreement.
