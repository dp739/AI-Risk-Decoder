Effective December 18, 2025

To use[Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview),[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com), and the other Google developer services that reference these terms (collectively, the "**APIs** " or "**Services** "), you must accept (1) the[Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)(the "**API Terms** "), and (2) these Gemini API Additional Terms of Service (the "**Additional Terms**"). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms have the meanings given in the API Terms.

## Age Requirements

You must be 18 years of age or older to use the APIs. You also will not use the Services as part of a website, application, or other service (collectively, "**API Clients**") that is directed towards or is likely to be accessed by individuals under the age of 18.

## Use Restrictions

Use of Google AI Studio and Gemini API is for developers building with Google AI models for professional or business purposes, not for consumer use.

You may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within an[available region](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions).**You may use only Paid Services when making API Clients available to users in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.**

You may not use the Services to develop models that compete with the Services (e.g., Gemini API or Google AI Studio). You also may not attempt to reverse engineer, extract or replicate any component of the Services, including the underlying data or models (e.g., parameter weights).

In addition to the "[API Prohibitions](https://developers.google.com/terms#a_api_prohibitions)" section in the API Terms, you must comply with our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), which provides additional details about appropriate conduct when using the Services.

The Services include safety features to block harmful content, such as content that violates our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy). You may not attempt to bypass these protective measures or use content that violates the API Terms or these Additional Terms. You are responsible for determining the necessary and appropriate[safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety_setting_gemini)and factuality tools for your use case. Applications with less restrictive safety settings may be subject to Google's review and approval.

You may not use the Services in clinical practice, to provide medical advice, or in any manner that is overseen by or requires clearance or approval from a medical device regulatory agency.

## Use of Generated Content

Some of our Services allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim ownership over that content. You acknowledge that Google may generate the same or similar content for others and that we reserve all rights to do so.

As required by the API Terms, you'll comply with applicable law in using generated content, which may require the provision of[attribution](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/CitationMetadata)to your users when returned as part of an API call. Use discretion before relying on generated content, including[code](https://g.co/legal/generative-code). You're responsible for your use of generated content, and for the use of that content by anyone you share it with.

## Unpaid Services

Any Services that are offered free of charge like direct interactions with Google AI Studio or unpaid quota in Gemini API are unpaid Services (the "**Unpaid Services**").

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Unpaid Services, including, for example, Google AI Studio and the unpaid quota on Gemini API, Google uses the content you submit to the Services and any generated responses to provide, improve, and develop Google products and services and machine learning technologies, including Google's enterprise features, products, and services, consistent with our[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

To help with quality and improve our products, human reviewers may read, annotate, and process your API input and output. Google takes steps to protect your privacy as part of this process. This includes disconnecting this data from your Google Account, API key, and Cloud project before reviewers see or annotate it.**Do not submit sensitive, confidential, or personal information to the Unpaid Services.**

The license you grant to Google under the "[Submission of Content](https://developers.google.com/terms#b_submission_of_content)" section in the API Terms also extends, to the extent required under applicable law for our use, to any content (e.g., prompts, including associated system instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) you submit to the Services and to any generated responses.

Google only uses content that you import or upload to our model tuning feature for that express purpose. Tuning content may be retained in connection with your tuned models for purposes of re-tuning when supported models change. When you delete a tuned model, the related tuning content is also deleted.

If you're in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, the terms under "[How Google uses Your Data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid)" in "[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)" apply to all Services, including Google AI Studio and unpaid quota in the Gemini API, even though they are offered free of charge.

## Paid Services

When a Service is being offered for a fee, it is considered to be a paid Service (the "**Paid Services** "). Your access to Google AI Studio is a "Paid Service" even when it is offered free of charge, as long as the account you are using to access Google AI Studio has access to a Cloud Project with an associated and active[Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts)or is a Workspace enterprise account. Your access to Gemini API is a "Paid Service" only when accessing the API through a Cloud Project associated with an active billing account.

For Paid Services, "Google" as used in these Terms has the meaning given[here](https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity).

### How Google Uses Your Data

When you use Paid Services, including, for example, the paid quota of the Gemini API, Google doesn't use your prompts (including associated system instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) or responses to improve our products, and will process your prompts and responses in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/). For Paid Services, Google logs prompts and responses for a limited period of time, solely for the purpose of detecting violations of the[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy)and any required legal or regulatory disclosures. This data may be stored transiently or cached in any country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities.

Other data we collect while providing the Paid Services to you, such as account information and settings, billing history, direct communications and feedback, and usage details (e.g., information about usage including token count per prompt and response, operational status, safety filter triggers, software errors and crash reports, authentication details, quality and performance metrics, and other technical details necessary for Google to operate and maintain Services, which may include device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP addresses) remains subject to the[Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://business.safety.google/controllerterms/)and[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)referenced in the API Terms.

When using Grounding with Google Search, additional data is collected and used, as detailed in the "[Grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#grounding-with-google-search)" section below.

### Payment Terms

Billing and payments for Paid Services are handled by[Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts)in the Google Cloud Platform.

As such, Section 2 (Payment Terms) and Section 14 (Miscellaneous) of the[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)govern payments, invoicing, billing, payment disputes, and related issues, while these Terms govern your use of the Paid Services. These Terms do not govern your direct use of any Google Cloud Platform service (including those listed on the[Google Cloud Platform Services Summary](https://cloud.google.com/terms/services)).

"**Fees** " (as used in the[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)) for Paid Services are as specified on our[pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)page. Google may make changes to this pricing from time to time, effective 30 days after they are posted unless otherwise specified (or in the case of new Paid Services, where pricing takes effect immediately unless otherwise specified). Your continued use of the Paid Services constitutes your consent to those changes.

## Agentic Services

When using agentic services, including the Computer Use API, you are solely responsible for the actions and tasks performed by the service, such as determining whether the service is appropriate for your use case, authorizing the service's access and connection to data, applications, and systems, and exercising judgment and supervision when and if the service is used in production environments. You will not automatically bypass any requests for human confirmation.

## Grounding with Google Search

"Grounding with Google Search" is a Service that provides Grounded Results and Search Suggestions and can be used through Google AI Studio (as an Unpaid Service), and via Gemini API as a (Paid Service). "Grounded Results" mean responses that Google generates using the prompt from the end user (or from you, when using function calling), contextual information that you may provide (as applicable), and results from Google's search engine. "Search Suggestions" mean search suggestions that Google provides with the Grounded Results. If a Grounded Result is clicked on, separate terms (not these terms) govern the destination page. If a Search Suggestion is clicked on the[Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)govern the[google.com](http://google.com)destination page. "Links" are any other means to fetch web pages (including hyperlinks and URLs), which may be contained in a Grounded Result or Search Suggestion. Links also include titles or labels provided with those means to fetch web pages. Excluding your web domain(s), you will not assert ownership rights in any intellectual property in Search Suggestions or Links in Grounded Results.

### Use Restrictions

- You will only use Grounding with Google Search in an application that is owned and operated by you and will only display the Grounded Results with the associated Search Suggestion(s) to the end user who submitted the prompt.
- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, cache, frame, syndicate, resell, analyze, train on, or otherwise learn from Grounded Results or Search Suggestions. For clarity, Grounded Results, Search Suggestions, and Links are intended to be used in combination to respond to a given end user prompt and it is a violation of these terms to use Grounding with Google Search to extract or collect one or more of these components for another purpose (for example, using programmatic or automated means to collect Links, using Links to build an index, or using Links to identify destination pages for crawling or scraping).
- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, copy, store, or implement any click tracking, Link-tracking or other monitoring of Grounded Results or Search Suggestions, except that:
  - You may copy and store, for up to two (2) years, the text of the Grounded Result(s): (1) that were displayed by you only to evaluate and optimize the display of the Grounded Results in your application; (2) in chat history of an end user of your application only for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history; and (3) temporarily for the purpose of resubmitting the text of the Grounded Result in a subsequent prompt that you submit to Google via a function call to obtain a refined or improved Grounded Result to display to the end user, as long as the developer: (i) does not use the interim Grounded Results for any other purpose; (ii) deletes any Grounded Result that is not displayed to the end user once the final Grounded Result is generated; and (iii) displays any associated Search Suggestions or other Links (as applicable) with the final Grounded Result (up to a maximum of 5 Search Suggestions) to the end user.
  - You may copy and store the Grounded Result and Search Suggestions solely for the purpose of and for the minimum time necessary to comply with applicable law or regulations.
  - You may allow end user(s) to copy and store individual Grounded Results that were displayed to them through your application as long as you do not allow Grounded Results to be accessed or collected by automated or programmatic means or to be used to create a database.
  - You may monitor end user interactions with your application interface; however, you will not track whether those interactions were specifically with a given Search Suggestion or Grounded Result (in each case, in whole or in part, including any specific Link).
- Unless permitted by Google in writing, you: (1) will not modify, or intersperse any other content with, the Grounded Results or Search Suggestions; and (2) will not place any interstitial content between any Link or Search Suggestions and the associated destination page, redirect end users away from the destination pages, or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.

### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data

In addition to the general terms above ("How Google Uses Your Data" under "[Unpaid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services)" and "[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)"), when using Grounding with Google Search, Google will store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and output for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Grounded Results and Search Suggestions and the stored information can be used for debugging and testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Search. When using Grounding with Google Search via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).

This subsection "Grounding with Google Search" will survive termination of the Agreement, as applicable.

The[Client Application Guidelines](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10926790)apply to your use of Grounding with Google Search. For purposes of the Client Application Guidelines, your applications that are using Grounding with Google Search are considered Approved Applications.

## Grounding with Google Maps

"Grounding with Google Maps" is a Service that provides Google Maps Grounded Results as a feature of Gemini API. "Google Maps Grounded Results" mean responses that Google generates using Google Maps Data in response to an end user initiated prompt. "Google Maps Data" means the content originating from Google Maps in the Google Maps Grounded Results, including in the output text, in the metadata of the Google Maps Grounded Results, in the Google Maps Links, and content accessed through Google Maps Links. "Google Maps Links" mean the URLs that Google provides in a Google Maps Grounded Result and any titles or labels provided with those URLs. If Google Maps Links are clicked on, these separate[Google Maps End User Terms](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html)and the[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)govern the destination page. Google Maps Data in the text of a Google Maps Grounded Result will be identified via the Google Maps Links. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Google and its content providers retain all rights to Google Maps Data.

### Use restrictions

1. You will only use Grounding with Google Maps in an application that is owned and operated by you and will only use Grounding with Google Maps to display the Google Maps Grounded Results with the associated Google Maps Links to the end user who initiated the prompt. An end user is an individual you permit to use your application.

2. You will not modify the Google Maps Grounded Result or intersperse any other content with the Google Maps Grounded Result, place any interstitial content between the text of the Google Maps Grounded Result and the Google Maps Links or the Google Maps Links and the associated destination page, or redirect end users away from the destination pages or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.

3. You will comply with the Documentation for Grounding with Google Maps.

4. You will not, and will not allow your end users or any third party to:

   1. cache or store Google Maps Grounded Results except that you may cache or store Google Maps Grounded Results:

      1. for up to ninety (90) days, only to evaluate and optimize the display of the Google Maps Grounded Results for your application; or,

      2. in the chat history of an end user in your application for up to six (6) months for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history or to maintain prior conversation context for that end user within your application (Section 4 (a) overrides any cache header);

   2. scrape or export any Google Maps Data;

   3. train on any Google Maps Data; or

   4. distribute or market any Customer Applications in any Prohibited Territory as defined in the Documentation.

### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data

You acknowledge that it is reasonably necessary for Google to store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and generated content for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Google Maps Grounded Results, and since such information is being stored, you instruct Google that the stored information can be used for debugging and testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Maps. When using Grounding with Google Maps via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).

This subsection "Grounding with Google Maps" will survive termination of the Agreement, as applicable.
