        "NanoBananaToS.txt": "Source: https://developers.google.com/terms#c_registration\n\nLast modified: November 9, 2021 (see previous version)\n\nThank you for using Google's APIs, other developer services, and associated software (collectively, \"APIs\"). By accessing or using our APIs, you are agreeing to the terms below. If there is a conflict between these terms and additional terms applicable to a given API, the additional terms will control for that conflict. Collectively, we refer to the terms below, any additional terms, terms within the accompanying API documentation, and any applicable policies and guidelines as the \"Terms.\" You agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. So please read all the Terms carefully. If you use the APIs as an interface to, or in conjunction with other Google products or services, then the terms for those other products or services also apply.\n\nUnder the Terms, \"Google\" means Google LLC, with offices at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, United States, unless set forth otherwise in additional terms applicable for a given API. We may refer to \"Google\" as \"we\", \"our\", or \"us\" in the Terms.\n\nSection 1: Account and Registration\na. Accepting the Terms\nYou may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if (a) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Google, or (b) you are a person barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the APIs.\n\nb. Entity Level Acceptance\nIf you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to \"you\" in the Terms refer to that entity).\n\nc. Registration\nIn order to access certain APIs you may be required to provide certain information (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for the APIs, or as part of your continued use of the APIs. Any registration information you give to Google will always be accurate and up to date and you'll inform us promptly of any updates.\n\nd. Subsidiaries and Affiliates\nGoogle has subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world. These companies may provide the APIs to you on behalf of Google and the Terms will also govern your relationship with these companies.\n\nSection 2: Using Our APIs\na. Your End Users\nYou will require your end users to comply with (and not knowingly enable them to violate) applicable law, regulation, and the Terms.\n\nb. Compliance with Law, Third Party Rights, and Other Google Terms of Service\nYou will comply with all applicable law, regulation, and third party rights (including without limitation laws regarding the import or export of data or software, privacy, and local laws). You will not use the APIs to encourage or promote illegal activity or violation of third party rights. You will not violate any other terms of service with Google (or its affiliates).\n\nc. Permitted Access\nYou will only access (or attempt to access) an API by the means described in the documentation of that API. If Google assigns you developer credentials (e.g. client IDs), you must use them with the applicable APIs. You will not misrepresent or mask either your identity or your API Client's identity when using the APIs or developer accounts.\n\nd. API Limitations\nGoogle sets and enforces limits on your use of the APIs (e.g. limiting the number of API requests that you may make or the number of users you may serve), in our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API. If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain Google's express consent (and Google may decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for that use). To seek such approval, contact the relevant Google API team for information (e.g. by using the Google developers console).\n\ne. Open Source Software\nSome of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. For certain APIs, open source software is listed in the documentation. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Google for the applicable open source software.\n\nf. Communication with Google\nWe may send you certain communications in connection with your use of the APIs. Please review the applicable API documentation for information about opting out of certain types of communication.\n\ng. Feedback\nIf you provide feedback or suggestions about our APIs, then we (and those we allow) may use such information without obligation to you.\n\nh. Non-Exclusivity\nThe Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Google may develop products or services that may compete with the API Clients or any other products or services.\n\ni. Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms\nTo the extent required by data protection laws applicable to the parties' processing of personal data under these Terms, the parties agree to the Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms.\n\nSection 3: Your API Clients\na. API Clients and Monitoring\nThe APIs are designed to help you enhance your websites and applications (\"API Client(s)\"). YOU AGREE THAT GOOGLE MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE GOOGLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. This monitoring may include Google accessing and using your API Client, for example to identify security issues that could affect Google or its users. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Google may use any technical means to overcome such interference. Google may suspend access to the APIs by you or your API Client without notice if we reasonably believe that you are in violation of the Terms.\n\nb. Security\nYou will use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information collected by your API Client, including personal data, from unauthorized access or use and will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of such information to the extent required by applicable law.\n\nc. Ownership\nGoogle does not acquire ownership in your API Clients, and by using our APIs, you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs or the content that is accessed through our APIs.\n\nd. User Privacy and API Clients\nYou will comply with (1) all applicable privacy laws and regulations including those applying to personal data and (2) the Google API Services User Data Policy, which governs your use of the APIs when you request access to Google user information. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your API Client that clearly and accurately describes to users of your API Client what user information you collect and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Google and third parties.\n\nSection 4: Prohibitions and Confidentiality\na. API Prohibitions\nWhen using the APIs, you may not (or allow those acting on your behalf to):\n\nSublicense an API for use by a third party. Consequently, you will not create an API Client that functions substantially the same as the APIs and offer it for use by third parties.\nPerform an action with the intent of introducing to Google products and services any viruses, worms, defects, Trojan horses, malware, or any items of a destructive nature.\nDefame, abuse, harass, stalk, or threaten others.\nInterfere with or disrupt the APIs or the servers or networks providing the APIs.\nPromote or facilitate unlawful online gambling or disruptive commercial messages or advertisements.\nReverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code from any API or any related software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.\nUse the APIs for any activities where the use or failure of the APIs could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control, or life support systems).\nUse the APIs to process or store any data that is subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations maintained by the U.S. Department of State.\nRemove, obscure, or alter any Google terms of service or any links to or notices of those terms.\nUnless otherwise specified in writing by Google, Google does not intend use of the APIs to create obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (\"HIPAA\"), and makes no representations that the APIs satisfy HIPAA requirements. If you are (or become) a \"covered entity\" or \"business associate\" as defined in HIPAA, you will not use the APIs for any purpose or in any manner involving transmitting protected health information to Google unless you have received prior written consent to such use from Google.\n\nb. Confidential Matters\nDeveloper credentials (such as passwords, keys, and client IDs) are intended to be used by you and identify your API Client. You will keep your credentials confidential and make reasonable efforts to prevent and discourage other API Clients from using your credentials. Developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.\nOur communications to you and our APIs may contain Google confidential information. Google confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances. If you receive any such information, then you will not disclose it to any third party without Google's prior written consent. Google confidential information does not include information that you independently developed, that was rightfully given to you by a third party without confidentiality obligation, or that becomes public through no fault of your own. You may disclose Google confidential information when compelled to do so by law if you provide us reasonable prior notice, unless a court orders that we not receive notice.\nSection 5: Content\na. Content Accessible Through our APIs\nOur APIs contain some third party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available. We may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms, and we may remove or refuse to display content. Finally, content accessible through our APIs may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that content or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the content provided by the API may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.\n\nb. Submission of Content\nSome of our APIs allow the submission of content. Google does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights in the content that you submit to our APIs through your API Client, except as expressly provided in the Terms. For the sole purpose of enabling Google to provide, secure, and improve the APIs (and the related service(s)) and only in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policies, you give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to Use content submitted, posted, or displayed to or from the APIs through your API Client. \"Use\" means use, host, store, modify, communicate, and publish. Before you submit content to our APIs through your API Client, you will ensure that you have the necessary rights (including the necessary rights from your end users) to grant us the license.\n\nc. Retrieval of content\nWhen a user's non-public content is obtained through the APIs, you may not expose that content to other users or to third parties without explicit opt-in consent from that user.\n\nd. Data Portability\nGoogle supports data portability. For as long as you use or store any user data that you obtained through the APIs, you agree to enable your users to export their equivalent data to other services or applications of their choice in a way that's substantially as fast and easy as exporting such data from Google products and services, subject to applicable laws, and you agree that you will not make that data available to third parties who do not also abide by this obligation.\n\ne. Prohibitions on Content\nUnless expressly permitted by the content owner or by applicable law, you will not, and will not permit your end users or others acting on your behalf to, do the following with content returned from the APIs:\n\nScrape, build databases, or otherwise create permanent copies of such content, or keep cached copies longer than permitted by the cache header;\nCopy, translate, modify, create a derivative work of, sell, lease, lend, convey, distribute, publicly display, or sublicense to any third party;\nMisrepresent the source or ownership; or\nRemove, obscure, or alter any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices; or falsify or delete any author attributions, legal notices, or other labels of the origin or source of material.\nSection 6: Brand Features; Attribution\na.

Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Google's Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Google.\n\nb. Attribution\nYou agree to display any attribution(s) required by Google as described in the documentation for the API. Google hereby grants to you a nontransferable, nonsublicenseable, nonexclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Google's Brand Features for the purpose of promoting or advertising that you use the APIs. You must only use the Google Brand Features in accordance with the Terms and for the purpose of fulfilling your obligations under this Section. In using Google's Brand Features, you must follow the Google Brand Features Use Guidelines. You understand and agree that Google has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Google's Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines.\n\nc. Publicity\nYou will not make any statement regarding your use of an API which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Google without Google's prior written approval.\n\nd. Promotional and Marketing Use\nIn the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs you are using and the associated Google products, Google may produce and distribute incidental depictions, including screenshots, video, or other content from your API Client, and may use your company or product name. You grant us all necessary rights for the above purposes.\n\nSection 7: Privacy and Copyright Protection\na. Google Privacy Policies\nBy using our APIs, Google may use submitted information in accordance with our privacy policies.\n\nb. Google DMCA Policy\nWe provide information to help copyright holders manage their intellectual property online, but we can't determine whether something is being used legally or not without their input. We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices and Google's policy about responding to notices in our Help Center.\n\nSection 8: Termination\na. Termination\nYou may stop using our APIs at any time with or without notice. Further, if you want to terminate the Terms, you must provide Google with prior written notice and upon termination, cease your use of the applicable APIs. Google reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you or discontinue the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto for any reason and at any time without liability or other obligation to you.\n\nb. Your Obligations Post-Termination\nUpon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to an API, you will immediately stop using the API, cease all use of the Google Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored content that was permitted by the cache header under Section 5. Google may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your API Client and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.\n\nc. Surviving Provisions\nWhen the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including but not limited to: Sections 4b, 5, 8, 9, and 10.\n\nSection 9: Liability for our APIs\na. WARRANTIES\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THE TERMS, NEITHER GOOGLE NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT ACCESSED THROUGH THE APIS, THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIS, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE APIS \"AS IS\".\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.\n\nb.

Indemnification\nUnless prohibited by applicable law, if you are a business, you will defend and indemnify Google, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, against all liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal fees), and expenses relating to any allegation or third-party legal proceeding to the extent arising from:\n\nyour misuse or your end user's misuse of the APIs;\nyour violation or your end user's violation of the Terms; or\nany content or data routed into or used with the APIs by you, those acting on your behalf, or your end users.\nSection 10: General Provisions\na. Modification\nWe may modify the Terms or any portion to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our APIs. You should look at the Terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to the Terms within the documentation of each applicable API, to this website, and/or in the Google developers console. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than 30 days after they are posted. But changes addressing new functions for an API or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms for an API, you should discontinue your use of that API. Your continued use of the API constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.\n\nb. U.S. Federal Agency Entities\nThe APIs were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.\n\nc. General Legal Terms\nWe each agree to contract in the English language. If we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Google does not take action right away, this does not mean that Google is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Google relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\n\nExcept as set forth below: (i) the laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California's conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs and (ii) ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE APIS WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, USA, AND YOU AND GOOGLE CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN THOSE COURTS.\n\nIf you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States federal government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the laws of the United States of America, excluding its conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or related to the Terms or the APIs. Solely to the extent permitted by United States Federal law: (i) the laws of the State of California (excluding California's conflict of laws rules) will apply in the absence of applicable federal law; and (ii) FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR THE APIS, THE PARTIES CONSENT TO PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN, AND THE EXCLUSIVE VENUE OF, THE COURTS IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.\n\nIf you are accepting the Terms on behalf of a United States city, county, or state government entity, then the following applies instead of the paragraph above: the parties agree to remain silent regarding governing law and venue."

We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can\u2019t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.\n\nYou are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.\n\nTo the extent the Services operate on or with a hosted application platform operated by a third party (such as Google Chrome Web Store, Gmail, and Google Apps), Clockwise shall not be responsible for the operation of any such third party service, nor the availability or operation of the Services to the extent such availability and operation is dependent upon the availability and operation of such third party hosted application platforms. You shall be solely responsible for procuring any rights necessary for you to access such service and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions.\n\nThe Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Clockwise. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Clockwise is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.\n\nClockwise has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services.

If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: \"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.\"\n\nWill Clockwise ever change the Services?\nWe\u2019re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.\n\nDo the Services cost anything?\nThe Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services. If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.\n\nPaid Services. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the \u201cPaid Services\u201d). Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.\nBilling. We use a third-party payment processor (the \u201cPayment Processor\u201d) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your \u201cBilling Account\u201d) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as our Payment Processor. You can access Stripe\u2019s Terms of Service at https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal and their Privacy Policy at https://stripe.com/us/privacy. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your \u201cPayment Method\u201d). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.\nPayment Method. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.\nRecurring Billing. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO ACCOUNT SETTINGS.\nCurrent Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT ACCOUNT SETTINGS. IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.\nChange in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.\nAuto-Renewal for Paid Services. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your account settings, any Paid Services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Paid Services at any time, go to account settings. If you terminate a Paid Service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term, and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, you must cancel the applicable Paid Service through your account settings before the end of the recurring term. Paid Services cannot be terminated before the end of the period for which you have already paid, and except as expressly provided in these terms, Clockwise will not refund any fees that you have already paid.\nReaffirmation of Authorization. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.\nFree Trials and Other Promotions. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at support@getclockwise.com.\nWhat if I want to stop using the Services?\nYou\u2019re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at support@getclockwise.com; please refer to Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.\n\nClockwise is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Clockwise has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.\n\nAccount termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.\n\nProvisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.\n\nI use the Clockwise App available via an app store \u2013 should I know anything about that?\nYou acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Application is dependent on the third party websites from which you download the Application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an \u201cApp Store\u201d). Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the Apple, Inc. Device and Application Terms for the Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Service apply.\n\nApple, Inc. Device and Application Terms\nThese Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the iOS applications available via the Apple, Inc. (\u201cApple\u201d) App Store (the \u201cApplication\u201d), but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:\n\nBoth you and Clockwise acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Clockwise only, and not with Apple, and that Apple is not responsible for the Application or the Content;\nThe Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;\nYou will only use the Application in connection with an Apple device that you own or control;\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;\nIn the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple of such failure; upon notification, Apple\u2019s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;\nYou acknowledge and agree that Clockwise, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;\nYou acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, Clockwise, and not Apple, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;\nYou represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \u201cterrorist supporting\u201d country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;\nBoth you and Clockwise acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and\nBoth you and Clockwise acknowledge and agree that Apple and Apple\u2019s subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.\nWhat else do I need to know?\nWarranty Disclaimer.\nNeither Clockwise nor its licensors or suppliers make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services. We (and our licensors and suppliers) make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through the Services. Products and services purchased or offered (whether or not following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are provided \u201cAS IS\u201d and without any warranty of any kind from Clockwise or others (unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in writing by a designated third party for a specific product). THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY CLOCKWISE (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN \u201cAS-IS\u201d BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\nTO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL CLOCKWISE (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO CLOCKWISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nIndemnity.\nTo the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Clockwise, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (\u201cClaim\u201d), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder). Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Clockwise\u2019s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.\n\nChoice of Law.\nThese Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.\n\nArbitration Agreement.\nPlease read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Clockwise and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Both you and Clockwise acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Clockwise\u2019s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (\u201cPersonnel\u201d) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.\n\nArbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction.\nCosts of Arbitration. The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Clockwise will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. Clockwise will not seek its attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.\nSmall Claims Court. Furthermore, either you or Clockwise may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or any United States county where you live or work.\nWaiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND CLOCKWISE WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Clockwise are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Clockwise over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND CLOCKWISE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\nWaiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.\nOpt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:\n\nClockwise Inc.\n2261 Market Street #5100\nSan Francisco, CA 94114\n\npostmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms\u2019 arbitration agreement.\nExclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Clockwise to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and Clockwise agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco County, California, or the Northern District of California.\nMiscellaneous.\nYou will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Clockwise may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Clockwise agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Clockwise, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms,. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Clockwise, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Clockwise in any respect whatsoever.\n\nExcept as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Clockwise agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.",

        "GeminiApiAdditionalToS.txt": "Source: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms\n\nEffective December 18, 2025\n\nTo use[Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview),[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com), and the other Google developer services that reference these terms (collectively, the \"**APIs** \" or \"**Services** \"), you must accept (1) the[Google APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/terms)(the \"**API Terms** \"), and (2) these Gemini API Additional Terms of Service (the \"**Additional Terms**\"). Terms that are not defined in these Additional Terms have the meanings given in the API Terms.\n\n## Age Requirements\n\nYou must be 18 years of age or older to use the APIs. You also will not use the Services as part of a website, application, or other service (collectively, \"**API Clients**\") that is directed towards or is likely to be accessed by individuals under the age of 18.\n\n## Use Restrictions\n\nUse of Google AI Studio and Gemini API is for developers building with Google AI models for professional or business purposes, not for consumer use.\n\nYou may only access the Services (or make API Clients available to users) within an[available region](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions).**You may use only Paid Services when making API Clients available to users in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.**\n\nYou may not use the Services to develop models that compete with the Services (e.g., Gemini API or Google AI Studio). You also may not attempt to reverse engineer, extract or replicate any component of the Services, including the underlying data or models (e.g., parameter weights).\n\nIn addition to the \"[API Prohibitions](https://developers.google.com/terms#a_api_prohibitions)\" section in the API Terms, you must comply with our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy), which provides additional details about appropriate conduct when using the Services.\n\nThe Services include safety features to block harmful content, such as content that violates our[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy). You may not attempt to bypass these protective measures or use content that violates the API Terms or these Additional Terms. You are responsible for determining the necessary and appropriate[safety settings](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/safety_setting_gemini)and factuality tools for your use case. Applications with less restrictive safety settings may be subject to Google's review and approval.\n\nYou may not use the Services in clinical practice, to provide medical advice, or in any manner that is overseen by or requires clearance or approval from a medical device regulatory agency.\n\n## Use of Generated Content\n\nSome of our Services allow you to generate original content. Google won't claim ownership over that content. You acknowledge that Google may generate the same or similar content for others and that we reserve all rights to do so.\n\nAs required by the API Terms, you'll comply with applicable law in using generated content, which may require the provision of[attribution](https://ai.google.dev/api/rest/v1beta/CitationMetadata)to your users when returned as part of an API call. Use discretion before relying on generated content, including[code](https://g.co/legal/generative-code). You're responsible for your use of generated content, and for the use of that content by anyone you share it with.\n\n## Unpaid Services\n\nAny Services that are offered free of charge like direct interactions with Google AI Studio or unpaid quota in Gemini API are unpaid Services (the \"**Unpaid Services**\").\n\n### How Google Uses Your Data\n\nWhen you use Unpaid Services, including, for example, Google AI Studio and the unpaid quota on Gemini API, Google uses the content you submit to the Services and any generated responses to provide, improve, and develop Google products and services and machine learning technologies, including Google's enterprise features, products, and services, consistent with our[Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).\n\nTo help with quality and improve our products, human reviewers may read, annotate, and process your API input and output. Google takes steps to protect your privacy as part of this process. This includes disconnecting this data from your Google Account, API key, and Cloud project before reviewers see or annotate it.**Do not submit sensitive, confidential, or personal information to the Unpaid Services.**\n\nThe license you grant to Google under the \"[Submission of Content](https://developers.google.com/terms#b_submission_of_content)\" section in the API Terms also extends, to the extent required under applicable law for our use, to any content (e.g., prompts, including associated system instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) you submit to the Services and to any generated responses.\n\nGoogle only uses content that you import or upload to our model tuning feature for that express purpose. Tuning content may be retained in connection with your tuned models for purposes of re-tuning when supported models change. When you delete a tuned model, the related tuning content is also deleted.\n\nIf you're in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, the terms under \"[How Google uses Your Data](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid)\" in \"[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)\" apply to all Services, including Google AI Studio and unpaid quota in the Gemini API, even though they are offered free of charge.\n\n## Paid Services\n\nWhen a Service is being offered for a fee, it is considered to be a paid Service (the \"**Paid Services** \"). Your access to Google AI Studio is a \"Paid Service\" even when it is offered free of charge, as long as the account you are using to access Google AI Studio has access to a Cloud Project with an associated and active[Cloud Billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts)or is a Workspace enterprise account. Your access to Gemini API is a \"Paid Service\" only when accessing the API through a Cloud Project associated with an active billing account.\n\nFor Paid Services, \"Google\" as used in these Terms has the meaning given[here](https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity).\n\n### How Google Uses Your Data\n\nWhen you use Paid Services, including, for example, the paid quota of the Gemini API, Google doesn't use your prompts (including associated system instructions, cached content, and files such as images, videos, or documents) or responses to improve our products, and will process your prompts and responses in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/). For Paid Services, Google logs prompts and responses for a limited period of time, solely for the purpose of detecting violations of the[Prohibited Use Policy](https://policies.google.com/terms/generative-ai/use-policy)and any required legal or regulatory disclosures. This data may be stored transiently or cached in any country in which Google or its agents maintain facilities.\n\nOther data we collect while providing the Paid Services to you, such as account information and settings, billing history, direct communications and feedback, and usage details (e.g., information about usage including token count per prompt and response, operational status, safety filter triggers, software errors and crash reports, authentication details, quality and performance metrics, and other technical details necessary for Google to operate and maintain Services, which may include device identifiers, identifiers from cookies or tokens, and IP addresses) remains subject to the[Google Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms](https://business.safety.google/controllerterms/)and[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)referenced in the API Terms.\n\nWhen using Grounding with Google Search, additional data is collected and used, as detailed in the \"[Grounding with Google Search](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#grounding-with-google-search)\" section below.\n\n### Payment Terms\n\nBilling and payments for Paid Services are handled by[Cloud Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/concepts)in the Google Cloud Platform.\n\nAs such, Section 2 (Payment Terms) and Section 14 (Miscellaneous) of the[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)govern payments, invoicing, billing, payment disputes, and related issues, while these Terms govern your use of the Paid Services. These Terms do not govern your direct use of any Google Cloud Platform service (including those listed on the[Google Cloud Platform Services Summary](https://cloud.google.com/terms/services)).\n\n\"**Fees** \" (as used in the[Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service](https://cloud.google.com/terms)) for Paid Services are as specified on our[pricing](https://ai.google.dev/pricing)page. Google may make changes to this pricing from time to time, effective 30 days after they are posted unless otherwise specified (or in the case of new Paid Services, where pricing takes effect immediately unless otherwise specified). Your continued use of the Paid Services constitutes your consent to those changes.\n\n## Agentic Services\n\nWhen using agentic services, including the Computer Use API, you are solely responsible for the actions and tasks performed by the service, such as determining whether the service is appropriate for your use case, authorizing the service's access and connection to data, applications, and systems, and exercising judgment and supervision when and if the service is used in production environments. You will not automatically bypass any requests for human confirmation.\n\n## Grounding with Google Search\n\n\"Grounding with Google Search\" is a Service that provides Grounded Results and Search Suggestions and can be used through Google AI Studio (as an Unpaid Service), and via Gemini API as a (Paid Service). \"Grounded Results\" mean responses that Google generates using the prompt from the end user (or from you, when using function calling), contextual information that you may provide (as applicable), and results from Google's search engine. \"Search Suggestions\" mean search suggestions that Google provides with the Grounded Results. If a Grounded Result is clicked on, separate terms (not these terms) govern the destination page. If a Search Suggestion is clicked on the[Google Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms)govern the[google.com](http://google.com)destination page. \"Links\" are any other means to fetch web pages (including hyperlinks and URLs), which may be contained in a Grounded Result or Search Suggestion. Links also include titles or labels provided with those means to fetch web pages. Excluding your web domain(s), you will not assert ownership rights in any intellectual property in Search Suggestions or Links in Grounded Results.\n\n### Use Restrictions\n\n- You will only use Grounding with Google Search in an application that is owned and operated by you and will only display the Grounded Results with the associated Search Suggestion(s) to the end user who submitted the prompt.\n- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, cache, frame, syndicate, resell, analyze, train on, or otherwise learn from Grounded Results or Search Suggestions. For clarity, Grounded Results, Search Suggestions, and Links are intended to be used in combination to respond to a given end user prompt and it is a violation of these terms to use Grounding with Google Search to extract or collect one or more of these components for another purpose (for example, using programmatic or automated means to collect Links, using Links to build an index, or using Links to identify destination pages for crawling or scraping).\n- You will not, and will not allow your end user or any third party to, copy, store, or implement any click tracking, Link-tracking or other monitoring of Grounded Results or Search Suggestions, except that:\n  - You may copy and store, for up to two (2) years, the text of the Grounded Result(s): (1) that were displayed by you only to evaluate and optimize the display of the Grounded Results in your application; (2) in chat history of an end user of your application only for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history; and (3) temporarily for the purpose of resubmitting the text of the Grounded Result in a subsequent prompt that you submit to Google via a function call to obtain a refined or improved Grounded Result to display to the end user, as long as the developer: (i) does not use the interim Grounded Results for any other purpose; (ii) deletes any Grounded Result that is not displayed to the end user once the final Grounded Result is generated; and (iii) displays any associated Search Suggestions or other Links (as applicable) with the final Grounded Result (up to a maximum of 5 Search Suggestions) to the end user.\n  - You may copy and store the Grounded Result and Search Suggestions solely for the purpose of and for the minimum time necessary to comply with applicable law or regulations.\n  - You may allow end user(s) to copy and store individual Grounded Results that were displayed to them through your application as long as you do not allow Grounded Results to be accessed or collected by automated or programmatic means or to be used to create a database.\n  - You may monitor end user interactions with your application interface; however, you will not track whether those interactions were specifically with a given Search Suggestion or Grounded Result (in each case, in whole or in part, including any specific Link).\n- Unless permitted by Google in writing, you: (1) will not modify, or intersperse any other content with, the Grounded Results or Search Suggestions; and (2) will not place any interstitial content between any Link or Search Suggestions and the associated destination page, redirect end users away from the destination pages, or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.\n\n### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data\n\nIn addition to the general terms above (\"How Google Uses Your Data\" under \"[Unpaid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#unpaid-services)\" and \"[Paid Services](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#paid-services)\"), when using Grounding with Google Search, Google will store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and output for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Grounded Results and Search Suggestions and the stored information can be used for debugging and testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Search. When using Grounding with Google Search via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).\n\nThis subsection \"Grounding with Google Search\" will survive termination of the Agreement, as applicable.\n\nThe[Client Application Guidelines](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/10926790)apply to your use of Grounding with Google Search. For purposes of the Client Application Guidelines, your applications that are using Grounding with Google Search are considered Approved Applications.\n\n## Grounding with Google Maps\n\n\"Grounding with Google Maps\" is a Service that provides Google Maps Grounded Results as a feature of Gemini API. \"Google Maps Grounded Results\" mean responses that Google generates using Google Maps Data in response to an end user initiated prompt. \"Google Maps Data\" means the content originating from Google Maps in the Google Maps Grounded Results, including in the output text, in the metadata of the Google Maps Grounded Results, in the Google Maps Links, and content accessed through Google Maps Links. \"Google Maps Links\" mean the URLs that Google provides in a Google Maps Grounded Result and any titles or labels provided with those URLs. If Google Maps Links are clicked on, these separate[Google Maps End User Terms](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html)and the[Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)govern the destination page. Google Maps Data in the text of a Google Maps Grounded Result will be identified via the Google Maps Links. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Google and its content providers retain all rights to Google Maps Data.\n\n### Use restrictions\n\n1. You will only use Grounding with Google Maps in an application that is owned and operated by you and will only use Grounding with Google Maps to display the Google Maps Grounded Results with the associated Google Maps Links to the end user who initiated the prompt. An end user is an individual you permit to use your application.\n\n2. You will not modify the Google Maps Grounded Result or intersperse any other content with the Google Maps Grounded Result, place any interstitial content between the text of the Google Maps Grounded Result and the Google Maps Links or the Google Maps Links and the associated destination page, or redirect end users away from the destination pages or minimize, remove, or otherwise inhibit the full and complete display of any destination page.\n\n3. You will comply with the Documentation for Grounding with Google Maps.\n\n4. You will not, and will not allow your end users or any third party to:\n\n   1. cache or store Google Maps Grounded Results except that you may cache or store Google Maps Grounded Results:\n\n      1. for up to ninety (90) days, only to evaluate and optimize the display of the Google Maps Grounded Results for your application; or,\n\n      2. in the chat history of an end user in your application for up to six (6) months for the purpose of allowing that end user to view their chat history or to maintain prior conversation context for that end user within your application (Section 4 (a) overrides any cache header);\n\n   2. scrape or export any Google Maps Data;\n\n   3. train on any Google Maps Data; or\n\n   4. distribute or market any Customer Applications in any Prohibited Territory as defined in the Documentation.\n\n### Data Collection and How Google Uses Your Data\n\nYou acknowledge that it is reasonably necessary for Google to store prompts, contextual information that you may provide, and generated content for thirty (30) days for the purposes of creating Google Maps Grounded Results, and since such information is being stored, you instruct Google that the stored information can be used for debugging and testing of systems that support Grounding with Google Maps. When using Grounding with Google Maps via paid quota of Gemini API, this processing for debugging and testing of systems is in accordance with the[Data Processing Addendum for Products Where Google is a Data Processor](https://business.safety.google/processorterms/).\n\nThis subsection \"Grounding with Google Maps\" will survive termination of the Agreement, as applicable.\n\n## Hardware Safety\n\nThe following additional terms apply to models that can be used to control robots or other robotic hardware (\"**Robotics Models**\").\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that the Robotics Models have not been tested with all makes and models of robotics hardware, and therefore, that the performance and safety of the Robotics Models in connection with your hardware is not guaranteed or provided with a warranty of any kind. You therefore agree to operate any hardware or other products that you may use in connection with the Robotics Models in a safe manner, and completely at your own risk. The Robotics Models may act in an unpredictable or unexpected manner when used in connection with robotics hardware. You therefore agree to use discretion before using the Robotics Models in a production, commercial, or public environment, and to not use the Robotics Models for safety-critical applications or work, such as in the following settings: (i) healthcare, (ii) transportation, or (iii) other areas where safety protocols are vital, and a malfunction could reasonably foreseeably lead to death, personal injury, or property damage.\n\n## **Disclaimers**\n\n**The Services include experimental technology and may sometimes provide inaccurate or offensive content that doesn't represent Google's views.**\n\n**Use discretion before relying on, publishing, or otherwise using content provided by the Services.**\n\n**Don't rely on the Services for medical, mental health, legal, financial, or other professional advice. Any content regarding those topics is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for advice from a qualified professional. Content does not constitute medical treatment or diagnosis.**\n| **Note:** Previous versions of these Additional Terms are[archived here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms-archive)."

No one under age 18 may provide any personal information to or on the Service. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at support@irisdating.com.\n\nInformation We Collect and How We Collect It\n\nWe collect information from and about users of our Service:\n\nDirectly from you when you provide it.\n\nAutomatically when you use the Service.\n\nFrom third-party sources, including social media platforms.\n\nInformation You Provide to Us\n\nWhen you use our Service, we may ask you to provide information:\n\nBy which you may be personally identified, such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number, payment information, or other identifiers.\n\nThat is about you but individually does not identify you, such as demographic information, interests, or preferences.\n\nProfile information, including a real-time photo of your face for verification purposes. Chat messages and interactions with other users.\n\nFacial Data Collection and Use\n\nWhy We Collect Face Data\nIRIS uses real-time selfie verification to confirm user authenticity, prevent fake accounts, and block repeat abusers. This data is essential to maintaining a safe and trusted user environment and may also be used to cooperate with lawful investigations.\n\nHow Long We Store Face Data\nFacial data is retained under the same rules as all other user data. It is stored for the duration of the user's account and for up to one year following account deletion, unless the user submits a verified request for earlier deletion.\n\nDo We Share Face Data?\nWe do not share facial data with third parties. The data is used internally by IRIS solely for verification, abuse prevention, and safety purposes.\n\nThird-Party Storage of Face Data\nBecause we do not share facial data with any third parties, no third parties store or process this data on our behalf.\n\nAutomatic Data Collection Technologies\n\nWe may use technologies like cookies, web beacons, and mobile device identifiers to collect:\n\nUsage Details: Logs, traffic data, and resources accessed.\n\nDevice Information: Device type, operating system, and unique device identifiers.\n\nLocation Information: Real-time location data.\n\nYou can manage these technologies through your device or browser settings.

However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for safeguarding your account credentials.\n\nYour Choices About Your Information\n\nYou have the right to:\n\nAccess and correct your information by logging into your account.\n\nDelete your account, which removes your data following a one-year safety retention period.\n\nOpt-out of marketing communications.\n\nControl location data collection through your device settings.\n\nCross-Border Transfers\n\nDepending on where you are located, sometimes your information may be subject to cross-border transfers. IRIS is intended for use by US residents.  But, if you are located in the European Economic Area (\u201cEEA\u201d), your personal information will be transferred outside of the EEA, for instance, to the United States of America and other jurisdictions. IF YOU ARE AN EU RESIDENT AND YOU PROVIDE INFORMATION TO IRIS, THEN YOU ARE CONSENTING TO THE TRANSFER OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD. YOU ARE ALSO CONSENTING TO OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT IRIS PROVIDES AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. \n\nData Subject Rights\n\nFor EU residents, Chapter 3 of the GDPR provides states you have eight rights. These are:\n\nThe right to be informed; This means anyone processing your personal data must make clear what they are processing, why, and who else the data may be passed to.\n\nThe right of access; this is your right to see what data is held about you by a Data Controller.\n\nThe right to rectification; the right to have your data corrected or amended if what is held is incorrect in some way.\n\nThe right to erasure; under certain circumstances you can ask for your personal data to be deleted. This is also called \u2018the Right to be Forgotten\u2019. This would apply if the personal data is no longer required for the purposes it was collected for, or your consent for the processing of that data has been withdrawn, or the personal data has been unlawfully processed.\n\nThe right to restrict processing; this gives the Data Subject the right to ask for a temporary halt to processing of personal data, such as in the case where a dispute or legal case has to be concluded, or the data is being corrected.\n\nThe right to data portability; a Data Subject has the right to ask for any data supplied directly to the Data Controller by him or her, to be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.\n\nThe right to object; the Data Subject has the right to object to further processing of their data which is inconsistent with the primary purpose for which it was collected, including profiling, automation, and direct marketing.\n\nRights in relation to automated decision making and profiling; Data Subjects have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing.\n\nIRIS is intended for use by US or North American residents.  Therefore, although we may use reasonable efforts to provide the eight rights listed above, we cannot guarantee that we will do so.\n\nState Privacy Rights\n\nResidents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Virginia, and Utah have specific rights regarding their personal information. These include:\n\nRight to Access: You have the right to request details about the personal information we have collected about you, including the categories of information and the purposes for which it is used.\n\nRight to Correct: You may request that we correct inaccuracies in your personal information.\n\nRight to Delete: You can ask us to delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nRight to Data Portability: You have the right to obtain a copy of your personal data in a portable and readily usable format.\n\nRight to Opt-Out: You can opt out of the sale of personal data or targeted advertising.\n\nTo exercise these rights, please visit your account settings in the App or contact us at support@irisdating.com. We will verify your identity before processing your request.\n\nAuthenticity and Transparency\n\nIRIS requires selfie verification for all users. This ensures that every account is associated with a real person, preventing the use of synthetic profiles or bots. We are committed to providing a genuine and trustworthy environment for all users.\n\nProhibited Content and Activities\n\nIRIS strictly prohibits any content or activities related to compensated companionship, exploitative dating practices, or any form of deceptive dating services. By using our Service, users agree to adhere to these standards.\n\nCompliance with Google Ads Policies\n\nWe maintain transparency and honesty in our practices, meeting the highest standards of advertising integrity. For specific requirements related to Google Ads policies, please see our Terms of Use.\n\nChanges in Our Privacy Policy\n\nWe will post any updates to this policy on this page.

Certain features of the Service may require you to pay fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Unless otherwise specifically provided for in these Terms, all fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable, except as required by law. The pricing and payment terms in this Section 4 are subject to any pricing and payment terms set forth in an Order Form.\n\n4.2. Pricing. Anysphere reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Anysphere will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Service up to date. We encourage you to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. Anysphere may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Anysphere gives you advance notice of changes before they apply through the Service user interface, a pop-up notice, email, or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You will be responsible for all taxes associated with the Service, other than taxes based on Anysphere\u2019s net income. Anysphere, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Anysphere\u2019s customers.

To facilitate payment for the Service via bank account, credit card, or debit card, we use Stripe, Inc. and its affiliates (\u201cStripe\u201d), a third-party payment processor. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the Stripe terms and conditions and other policies available at https://stripe.com/legal and Stripe\u2019s Global Privacy Policy available at: https://stripe.com/privacy (collectively, the \"Stripe Agreements\"). By agreeing to these Terms, users that use the payment functions of the Service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Agreements, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time.

Please contact Stripe for more information. Anysphere assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through the Service.\n\n4.4. Subscription Service. The Service may include certain subscription-based plans with automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (\u201cSubscription Service\u201d). The \u201cSubscription Billing Date\u201d is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. The Subscription Service will begin on the Subscription Billing Date and continue for the subscription period that you select on your account (such period, the \u201cInitial Subscription Period\u201d), and will automatically renew for successive periods of the same duration as the Initial Subscription Period (the Initial Subscription Period and each such renewal period, each a \u201cSubscription Period\u201d) unless you cancel the Subscription Service or we terminate it. If you activate a Subscription Service, then you authorize Anysphere or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription Service, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date. Information on the recurring fee charged by Anysphere for access to the Subscription Service during each Subscription Period (\u201cSubscription Fee\u201d), is available on our Pricing Page, or otherwise described in the Service. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date and thereafter on the renewal date of your Subscription Service for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period. You must cancel your Subscription Service at least 24 hours before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. Anysphere or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with your account or that you otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription Service by using the cancellation functionality made available in your billing menu or by contacting us at hi@cursor.com. YOUR CANCELLATION MUST BE RECEIVED BEFORE THE RENEWAL DATE IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGE FOR THE NEXT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.\n\n4.5. Add-On and Usage-Based Features. You may purchase additional products, services or features that are not individually essential for the functioning of the Service, but that Anysphere makes available to its users for enhanced capabilities on a supplemental basis, including usage-based pricing features that are described in the Service (\"Add-Ons\"). Add-Ons are deemed part of the Service and governed by these Terms. Fees for Add-Ons include our model-based pricing features, available here, or as otherwise described in the Service.\n\n4.6. Delinquent Accounts. Anysphere may suspend or terminate access to the Service, including fee-based portions of the Service, for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees. If your payment method is no longer valid at the time a renewal Subscription Fee is due, then Anysphere reserves the right to delete your account and any information associated with your account without any liability to you.\n\n5. Ownership and Licenses\n\n5.1. Service. Anysphere and its licensors shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to the Service, all improvements, enhancements or modifications thereto, and all intellectual property rights associated with the foregoing.

If you choose to provide input and suggestions regarding existing functionalities, problems with or proposed modifications or improvements to the Service (\u201cFeedback\u201d), then you grant Anysphere the right to exploit the Feedback without restriction or compensation to you.\n\n5.3.

Third-Party Services. The Service may include or incorporate optional third-party services, including without limitation extensions and plug-ins that you may install yourself (\u201cThird-Party Services\u201d). Anysphere will clearly indicate such content or features as Third-Party Services via prominent notices or descriptions in the Service. If you elect, in your sole discretion, to access or use a Third-Party Service, your access and use of the Third-Party Service is subject to the terms provided by that Third-Party Service, and you remain responsible for complying with those terms. Anysphere does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third-Party Services.\n\n7. Communications. We may send you emails concerning our products and services, as well as those of third parties. You may opt out of promotional emails by using any unsubscribe or similar functionality or instructions in the promotional email.\n\n8. Modification of Terms. We may, from time to time, change these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. If we make any material modifications, we will notify you by updating the date at the top of these Terms and by maintaining a current version of these Terms on this page. All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your continued accessing or use of the Service will serve as confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, then you must discontinue your use of the Service.\n\n9. Termination. You may stop accessing the Services at any time. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time without notice to you. Although we will strive to provide you with reasonable advance notice if we stop offering a Service, there may be urgent situations, such as preventing abuse or addressing security issues or responding to legal requirements, where providing advance notice is not feasible. We will not be liable for any change to or any suspension or discontinuation of the Services or your access to them. If you have a Subscription Service, we may terminate the Subscription Service at any time for any other reason. If we exercise this right, we will refund you on a pro rata basis the fees you paid for the remaining portion of your Subscription Service after termination, provided that if we terminate your access to the Service due to a violation of these Terms, you will not be entitled to any refund. We also may terminate your account if it has been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid account. If we do, we will provide you with advance notice. Upon termination of these Terms, a Subscription Service, or your access to the Service, we may at our option delete any Content or other data associated with your account. Sections 1.5, 4 (with respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination), 5, and 13-17 will survive any expiration or termination of our Terms or a Subscription Service. If you believe we have suspended or terminated your account in error, you can file an appeal with us by contacting hi@cursor.com.\n\n10. Modification of the Service. Anysphere may modify or discontinue all or any portion of the Service at any time (including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Service), temporarily or permanently, without notice to you. Anysphere will have no liability for any change to the Service, including any paid-for functionalities of the Service, or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Service. You should retain copies of any Content as needed so that you have access in the event the Service is modified and you lose access to such Content.\n\n11. Copyright complaints.

Privacy. Please read the Anysphere Privacy Policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, and disclosure of your personal data.\n\n13.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of those claims.\n\n14. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. THE SERVICE AND SUGGESTIONS ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ON AN \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS. ANYSPHERE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND SUGGESTIONS, INCLUDING: (a) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (b) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. ANYSPHERE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR SUGGESTIONS WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND ANYSPHERE DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED. YOU AGREE THAT ANY USE OF SUGGESTIONS FROM OUR SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND YOU WILL NOT RELY ON ANY SUGGESTION AS A SOURCE OF TRUTH. THE LAWS OF SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THESE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n15.1. NO INDIRECT DAMAGES. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE ANYSPHERE ENTITIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE, OR CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY ANYSPHERE ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.\n\n15.2. LIABILITY CAP. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE ANYSPHERE ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE SERVICE, AND CONTENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO ANYSPHERE FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR, IF GREATER, (B) $100. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO THESE TERMS, AND WE WOULD NOT OFFER THE SERVICE TO YOU UNDER THESE TERMS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.\n\n16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.\n\n16.1. Agreement to Arbitrate. This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in these Terms as the \u201cArbitration Agreement.\u201d You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Anysphere, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, any advertising, or any aspect of the relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, you and Anysphere are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect, by sending an email to legal@cursor.com from the email address used to create your account, and providing your first and last name and a clear statement of intent that you intend to exercise your right to opt out of mandatory arbitration.\n\n16.2. Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND ANYSPHERE AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND ANYSPHERE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S OR PARTY\u2019S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.\n\n16.3. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Anysphere is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer\u2019s satisfaction by emailing legal@cursor.com. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d) to Anysphere, Inc., 2261 Market Street STE 86466, San Francisco, CA 94114, with an electronic copy additionally sent to legal@cursor.com. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If Anysphere and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Anysphere may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Anysphere or you will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Anysphere is entitled.\n\n16.4. Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association\u2019s (\u201cAAA\u201d) rules and procedures, including the AAA\u2019s Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, the \u201cAAA Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website, https://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA\u2019s consumer arbitration page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. Unless Anysphere and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, Anysphere agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.\n\n16.5. Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Fees\u201d) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. To the extent any Arbitration Fees are not specifically allocated to either Anysphere or you under the AAA Rules, Anysphere and you shall split them equally; provided that if you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of such Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of any Arbitration Fees, Anysphere will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Anysphere will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys\u2019 fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.\n\n16.6. Confidentiality. All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.\n\n16.7. Severability. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of the subsection above titled \u201cProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief\u201d are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.\n\n16.8. Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, Anysphere agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Service, you may reject any such change by sending Anysphere written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).\n\n17. Miscellaneous\n\n17.1. General. These Terms, including the Privacy Policy, and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Anysphere regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms and all rights granted under these Terms, including with respect to your Content, at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.\n\n17.2. Governing Law. California law will govern these Terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. Except as provided in the Dispute Resolution section above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, California.\n\n17.3. Consent to Electronic Communications. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.\n\n17.4. Contact Information. You may contact us by sending correspondence to Anysphere, Inc., 2261 Market Street STE 86466, San Francisco, CA 94114, or by emailing us at hi@cursor.com.\n\n17.5. No Support. We are under no obligation to provide support for the Service. In instances where we may offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.\n\n17.6. Export and Trade Controls. You must comply with all applicable trade laws, including sanctions and export control laws. The Service may not be used in or for the benefit of, or exported or re-exported to (a) any U.S. embargoed country or territory or (b) any individual or entity with whom dealings are prohibited or restricted under applicable trade laws. Our Service may not be used for any end use prohibited by applicable trade laws, and your Input may not include material or information that requires a government license for release or export.\n\n#Consumer Addendum to Terms of Service\nLast updated January 13, 2025\n\nThis Consumer Addendum (\"Addendum\") supplements the Anysphere Terms of Service (\"Terms\") and applies to you if you are a consumer resident in the European Economic Area (\"EEA\"), Switzerland, the United Kingdom (\"UK\"), Brazil, Mexico, South Korea (Republic of Korea), or Taiwan.

However, there may be urgent situations (such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security issues) where providing advance notice is not feasible. If you do not wish to continue using the Service following such changes, you may cancel your Subscription Service by notifying us at hi@cursor.com before the changes take effect. If you exercise this right, we will refund you a portion of the Subscription Fee paid by you for the portion of your Subscription Period remaining after termination.\n\n3.

Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for: (i) death or personal injury caused by our negligence; (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or (iii) any matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability.\n\n(b) Foreseeable Loss. Except as set out in Section 3(a), we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time you accessed the Service or entered into your Subscription Service.\n\n(c) Liability Cap. Subject to Section 3(a), the liability cap in Section 15.2 of the Terms applies, except that the minimum amount shall be \u20ac100 (or \u00a3100 for UK residents) rather than $100.\n\n4.

(\u201cAnysphere\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) are strongly committed to respecting your privacy and keeping secure any information you share with us. This privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) explains how we collect, use, disclose, and process your personal data when you use Anysphere's software, platform, APIs, Documentation, and related tools, including at the website at www.cursor.com, and all related software made available by Anysphere to build, deploy, host, and manage software projects (\u201cService\u201d). It also tells you how you can access and update your personal information and describes the data protection rights that may be available under your country's or state's laws. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge you have been informed of and consent to our practices with regard to your personal information and data.\n\nPlease note that this Privacy Policy does not apply where Anysphere acts as a data processor and processes personal data on behalf of commercial customers using our commercial services, for example, if your employer has provisioned a Cursor account for you to use at work. Our use of that data is governed by our customer agreements covering access to and use of those offerings.\n\n#1. Personal data we collect\nWe collect the following categories of personal data:\n\nA. Personal data you provide to us directly\n\nWe collect personal data if you create an account to use our Service or communicate with us. This includes:\n\nAccount Information: Anysphere collects identifiers, such as your name and email address, when you sign up for an Anysphere account or to receive information about our Service.\n\nPayment Information: We collect your payment information if you seek to access any paid Anysphere products and services.\n\nInputs and Suggestions: The Service allows you to submit content (\"Inputs\"), which generate responses (\"Suggestions\") based on your Inputs. If you include personal data or reference external content in your Inputs, we will collect that information and it may be reproduced in the Suggestions we provide.\n\nCommunication Information: If you communicate with us, we collect your name, contact information, and the contents of any messages you send.\n\nFeedback: While using the Service, you may provide feedback, including ideas and suggestions for improvement or rating a Suggestion in response to an Input (\"Feedback\"). If you provide Feedback on the Service, we may store the entire exchange as part of your Feedback.\n\nB. Personal data we receive from your use of the Service\n\nWhen you use the Service, we also receive certain technical data automatically. This includes:\n\nDevice Information. Your device or browser automatically sends us information about when and how you install, access, or use our Service. This information may include your device type, browser information, operating system information, and mobile network or ISP. This information may depend on your settings and the type of device you use to access the Service.\n\nLog Information. We collect information about how our Service is performing, including your IP address, browser type and settings, error logs, and other ways that you interact with the Service.\n\nUsage Data. We collect information about your use of the Service, such as the dates and times of access, browsing history, search, information about the links you click, pages you view, and other information about how you use the Service, and technology on the devices you use to access the Service.\n\nCookies & Similar Technologies. We and our service providers utilize cookies, pixels, scripts, or similar technologies to operate and manage the Service and improve your experience. These technologies help us to recognize you, customize or personalize your experience, market additional products or services to you, and analyze and optimize your use of the Service, for example to help maintain your preferences. For more details about how we use these technologies, please visit our Cookie Policy.\n\nLocation Information. For security and performance reasons, for example to detect unusual login activity or provide more useful Suggestions, we may determine the geographic location from which your device accesses our Service using information such as your IP address.\n\nC. Information We Do Not Collect\n\nAnysphere does not knowingly collect sensitive or special category personal information, such as genetic data, biometric data for the purposes of uniquely identifying a natural person, health information, or religious information. Additionally, Anysphere does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our Service or content to children under the age of 18. If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under the age of 18, we will investigate and, if appropriate, delete the personal data and/or the account.\n\n#2. How we use personal data\nWe may use personal data for the following purposes:\n\nTo provide and maintain the Service, including optional features that enhance functionality and user experience.\n\nTo create, manage, and administer your account, including facilitating payments and responding to inquiries.\n\nTo improve and develop the Service and conduct research, including debugging and identifying or repairing issues that impair functionality.\n\nTo communicate with you, including sending updates, information about the Service, and events.\n\nTo prevent, detect, and investigate fraud, abuse, security incidents, and violations of our Terms of Service.\n\nTo comply with legal obligations and protect the rights, safety, privacy, and property of users, Anysphere, or third parties.\n\nTo investigate and resolve disputes or security issues.\n\nTo enforce our Terms of Service and other applicable agreements.\n\nWe do not use Inputs or Suggestions to train our models, or permit third parties to use them for training, unless: (1) they are flagged for security review (in which case we may analyze them to improve our ability to detect and enforce our Terms of Service), (2) you explicitly report them to us (for example, as Feedback), or (3) you\u2019ve explicitly agreed to their use for such training purposes. You can find instructions in the Service on how to manage your preferences regarding the use of Inputs and Suggestions for training.\n\nWe may aggregate or de-identify personal data so that it no longer identifies you, and use that information for the purposes described above, such as analyzing how the Service is used, improving or adding features, and conducting research. We will maintain de-identified information in its de-identified form and will not attempt to reidentify it, except as required by law.\n\n#3. How we share personal data\nWe may disclose your personal data in the following circumstances:\n\nService Providers and Business Partners: We may disclose personal data to third-party vendors and service providers who support our business operations and help us deliver and improve the Service. This includes third-party hosting, cloud infrastructure, model, analytics, customer support, safety monitoring, communications, payment processing, compliance services, and IT providers. These parties process personal data only as necessary to perform services on our behalf, consistent with our and your instructions and applicable law.\n\nBusiness Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, restructuring, bankruptcy, or other corporate transaction, personal data may be disclosed to counterparties and advisers as part of due diligence or transferred as part of the transaction.\n\nLegal Compliance and Protection of Rights: We may disclose personal data to government authorities or other third parties if we believe doing so is necessary to: (i) comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes, (ii) respond to lawful requests or investigations, (iii) protect the safety, rights, or property of any person, (iv) prevent fraud, security incidents, or other unlawful activity, (v) enforce our Terms of Service or other legal rights, or (vi) protect Anysphere against legal liability.\n\nAffiliates: We may share personal data with affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, us. They may use personal data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\n\nThird-Party Services and Integrations: The Service may include integrations with or links to third-party websites, applications, or services. If you choose to interact with these third parties, your personal data may be disclosed to them directly and governed by their own terms and privacy policies. Our linking or integrating with a third party does not imply endorsement or affiliation.\n\nBusiness Account Administrators: If you create an account using an email associated with an organization (e.g., your employer), we may disclose account-related information (such as your email address and account status) to that organization. If you're part of a business or enterprise account, administrators may access and manage your use of the Service.\n\nOther Users and Third Parties You Share Information With: Certain features of the Service may allow you to share Inputs, Suggestions, or other content with other users or third-party applications. Any information you voluntarily share with those parties is subject to their respective terms and privacy policies.\n\nWith Your Consent: We may disclose personal data when you give us permission to do so, including through features of the Service that are designed to share information.\n\nSubprocessors: For commercial uses of the Service where Anysphere acts as a data processor, you can review the third parties we engage on at trust.cursor.com/subprocessors.\n\n#4. Retention\nAnysphere retains your personal data only for as long as necessary to operate the Service effectively and to support legitimate business needs such as legal compliance, safety, dispute resolution, and enforcement of our agreements. The appropriate retention period varies depending on the purpose for which the personal data was collected, its sensitivity, potential risks associated with its use or exposure, and any applicable legal requirements.\n\nYour settings may also influence how long we keep certain types of data. For instance, some temporary interactions with the Service may not appear in your history and could be stored for a limited duration for purposes related to safety and system monitoring.\n\nWhen personal data is no longer needed, Anysphere and its service providers will follow procedures to delete, erase, de-identify, or anonymize it in compliance with applicable laws.\n\n#5. Security\nWe implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. You should use caution when deciding what information to share with the Service. We are not responsible for any circumvention of privacy settings or security features on the Service or on third-party websites linked through the Service.\n\n#6. Your rights and choices\nDepending on where you live and the laws that apply in your country of residence, you may have certain rights in relation to your personal data. These may include the right to access, delete, correct, or transfer your personal data; to object to or restrict how we process it; or to withdraw your consent where processing is based on consent. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.\n\nTo exercise any of these rights, you or your authorized agent may contact us at hi@cursor.com. We may request information to verify your identity before processing your request. If we deny your request, you may appeal by emailing the same address. Anysphere will not discriminate against you for exercising any privacy rights available under applicable law.\n\nThe rights available to you may include:\n\nRight to know what categories of personal data we collect, the purposes for which we use it, and the types of third parties with whom we share it.\n\nAccess and portability, meaning you can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and, where applicable, ask us to provide it in a portable format.\n\nDeletion of personal data collected from you in connection with your use of the Service, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nCorrection of inaccurate personal data we maintain about you. Please note that while we\u2019ll make reasonable efforts to address correction requests, due to the nature of our models, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of Suggestions generated by the Service.\n\nObjection to certain types of processing. Where applicable, we will stop processing unless we have legitimate legal grounds to continue.\n\nRestriction of our processing of your personal data in limited circumstances, such as while a correction request is pending.\n\nWithdrawal of consent, where the legal basis for our processing is based on your consent. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of prior processing.\n\nNo automated decisions: Anysphere does not make decisions based solely on automated processing that impact your legal rights or has similarly significant effects (e.g. your healthcare or financial circumstances).\n\nNo sale or targeted advertising: We do not \u201csell\u201d or \u201cshare\u201d personal data for cross-contextual behavioral advertising, and we do not process personal data for \u201ctargeted advertising\u201d purposes (as those terms are defined under applicable US state privacy laws). We also do not process sensitive personal data for the purposes of inferring characteristics about a consumer.\n\nAnysphere processes your personal data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy on servers located in various jurisdictions, including in the United States. While data protection laws vary by country, we apply the protections outlined in this policy to your personal data regardless of where it is processed, and we only transfer data in accordance with legally valid transfer mechanisms. For users in the European Economic Area, (\u201cEEA\u201d), when you access our Service, your personal data may be transferred to our United States servers to other countries outside the EEA and the UK. Where information is transferred outside the EEA or the UK, we require an adequate level of data protection.\n\n#7. Jurisdiction-Specific Disclosures\nSome jurisdictions require specific disclosures regarding how we handle your personal data. The table below supplements this Privacy Policy by providing additional details about the purpose of data collection, type of data collected, and legal basis.

Privacy policy changes\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will publish an updated version and effective date at the top of this page, unless another type of notice is legally required. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.\n\n#9.

Inputs, Outputs, Actions, and Materials.\nGenerally. You may be allowed to interact with our Services in a variety of formats (we call these \u201cInputs\u201d). Our Services may generate responses (we call these \u201cOutputs\u201d) or enable the Services to take actions on your behalf, such as software manipulation, data processing, and system interactions (we call these \"Actions\"), based on your Inputs. Inputs and Outputs collectively are \u201cMaterials.\u201d\n\nRights and Responsibilities. You are responsible for all Inputs you submit to our Services and all Actions. You must ensure that you have all rights, licenses, and permissions that are necessary for us to process such Inputs in accordance with our Terms and to provide the Services to you, including for example, to integrate with third-party services, to share Materials with others at your direction, and to take Actions. You must ensure that your submission of Inputs to us, or your sharing them with others, will not violate our Terms, our Acceptable Use Policy, or any laws or regulations applicable to those Inputs or Actions.

Different types of Service (including paid-for Services under a Subscription) may have technical restrictions associated with them, for example, the number of Prompts you may submit to the Service or the number of Outputs you may receive within a certain period of time (\u201cTechnical Limitation\u201d).

You confirm that the card or bank account which is being used as your Payment Method is yours, or that you have the authorization of the account holder to use it. If you use a Payment Method which you are not authorized to use, you will be liable to us for any losses that we suffer as a result of your use of that Payment Method.\n\nYou agree that we may charge the Payment Method for any applicable fees listed on our Services and any applicable tax. If the fees for these Services or features are specified to be recurring or based on usage (for example, a Subscription (see below)), you agree that we may charge these fees and applicable taxes to the Payment Method on a periodic basis.\n\nIf you purchase access to our Services through a distributor (e.g. an app store) (\u201cApp Distributor\u201d), then you will make payment to the App Distributor, and the App Distributor's terms in relation to payment methods, billing, and refunds will apply instead of these Terms.\n\nExcept as expressly provided in these Terms or where required by law, all payments are non-refundable. Please check your order carefully before confirming it, and see below for additional information about recurring charges for our subscriptions.\n\nYou agree that we will not be held liable for any errors caused by third-party payment processors used to process fees paid by you to us.\n\nSubscriptions. To access Claude Pro and other subscription services we may make available to individuals, you must sign up for a subscription with us (a \u201cSubscription\u201d), first by creating an Account and then following the subscription procedure on our Services. When you sign up for a Subscription, you agree to these Terms.\n\na. Subscription order. Your order for a Subscription constitutes an offer by you to enter into a Subscription with us. We will confirm our acceptance of your order by sending you a confirmation email (the \"Confirmation Email\"). Sometimes we reject orders, for example, if you are located in a country where we do not offer the Service or the Service was mispriced by us. These Terms will become legally binding on you and us when we send you the Confirmation Email and each Subscription will incorporate these Terms.\n\nb. Subscription content, features, and services. The content, features, and other services provided as part of your Subscription, and the duration of your Subscription, will be described in the order process. We may change or refresh the content, features, and other services from time to time, and we do not guarantee that any particular piece of content, feature, or other service will always be available through the Services.\n\nc. Subscription term and automatic renewal. If your Subscription has a minimum term (the \u201cInitial Term\u201d), we will let you know during the order process. Your Subscription will last for the Initial Term and will automatically renew for an additional term equal in duration to the Initial Term and will continue to renew and incur charges for additional terms equal in duration to the Initial Term (each such additional term, a \u201cRenewal Term\u201d). For example, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription with a one-month Initial Term, the Initial Term is January 25th to February 24th (inclusive) and then Renewal Terms will run from the 25th of one month to the 24th of the next month (inclusive).\n\nd. Subscription fees. You will pay the fees, either to us or to the App Distributor, for the Initial Term and each subsequent Renewal Term up front at the start of that Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. We have the right to make changes to the fees applicable to your Subscription from time to time, although we will not make any change to the fees applicable to your Subscription during the current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. If these changes result in an increase in the fees payable by you, we will inform you at least 30 days in advance of the change; you agree to the increase in fees payable by you unless you cancel the Subscription, as described in Sections (e-f) below, before the Renewal Term to which the increase in fees will apply.\n\ne. Subscription cancellation. If you subscribed via our website, you may cancel your Subscription at any time by using a method we may provide to you through our products (for example, for Claude Pro, in your customer portal) or by notifying us at support@anthropic.com. If you subscribed via an app, you will need to cancel via the distributor according to the App Distributor terms. Learn more here. To avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term, cancel your subscription at least 24 hours before the last day of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term. In the example above, if you subscribe on January 25th for a Subscription that renews with a one-month Initial Term, you must cancel the Subscription per the instructions by February 23rd (24 hours before February 24th) to avoid renewal and charges for the next Renewal Term. In the event of a cancellation, your fees will not be refunded, but your access to the Services will continue through the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term for which you previously paid fees.\n\nf. Additional cancellation rights. You have a legal right to change your mind and cancel the Subscription within 14 days of entering into the Subscription without giving a reason.\n\nTo exercise the right to cancel in the 14-day cancellation period, you must inform us of your decision to cancel the Subscription by making a clear statement to us of such decision before the cancellation period has expired. If you purchased your subscription on our website, the easiest way to do this is by cancelling your subscription in the customer portal, or you may contact us at support@anthropic.com. We will acknowledge your cancellation, e.g., through our online customer portal or console. For further details on how to cancel, please see support.anthropic.com.\nIf you cancel the Subscription under Section 6(f)(1), we will reimburse you all payments received from you for the cancelled Subscription. We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel the Subscription. We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction; you will not incur any fees as a result of the reimbursement.\nIf you would like to use the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, you may do so by accessing the Services, but you acknowledge that your right to cancel the Subscription will be lost and you will not be entitled to any refund under Section 6(f)(2). If you have used the Services during the 14-day cancellation period, and wish to cancel the Subscription, you can still do so by following the process in Section (e) above, but you will not be entitled to a refund.\nThe 14-day cancellation period will not reset if you change subscription tiers or cancel and then resubscribe, as you have already had an opportunity to test the Services.\nIf you are not paying under a subscription billing model, you do not have a right to a refund of unused tokens.\ng. Subscriptions purchased through third parties. Where you have purchased your Subscription through an App Distributor, your right to cancel under Section 6(f) above will be as set out in the App Distributor\u2019s terms and Section 6(f) will not apply. The App Distributor's terms will set out how to notify the App Distributor that you want to cancel and how any fees will be refunded.\n\nAdditional fees. We may also increase the fees for access to our Services that do not require a Subscription. If we charge additional fees in connection with those Services, we will give you an opportunity to review and accept the additional fees before you are charged. Also, additional fees may apply for additional Services or features of the Services that we may make available. If you do not accept any such additional fees, we may discontinue your access to those Services or features.\n\n7.

You can appeal a takedown of Third-Party Content by responding to the notice you receive from us.\n\nYou have a right to bring a claim for breach of contract in respect of these Terms in the event that (i) content which you generate, upload or share on our Services is taken down, or access to it is restricted, in breach of these Terms or (ii) your access is suspended (including any ban imposed on your use of our Services) in breach of these Terms.\n\n9. Software\nWe may offer manual or automatic updates to our software including our apps (\u201cAnthropic Software\u201d), without advance notice to you. Anthropic Software may include open source software. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other Anthropic or third-party terms applicable to any portion of Anthropic Software, such as open-source license terms, such other terms will control as to that portion of the Anthropic Software and to the extent of the conflict.\n\n10.

We and our Providers retain all our respective rights, title, and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Services.

However, there are certain aspects we can\u2019t guarantee.\n\nNo warranties. You may have legal rights in relation to our Services, including where the Services are not as described, faulty or otherwise not fit for purpose. If you believe that any of our Services that you have ordered do not conform with these Terms, please contact us at support@anthropic.com.

We and our Providers expressly disclaim any and all warranties of fitness for a particular purpose, title, merchantability, accuracy, availability, reliability, security, privacy, compatibility, non-infringement, and any warranty implied by course of dealing, course of performance, or trade usage.\n\nNo limitation. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits our liability for:\n\ndeath or personal injury caused by our negligence;\nfraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; and\nany matter in respect of which it would be unlawful for us to exclude or restrict our liability. If you have a paid-for Subscription, this includes your rights that the Services are of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose and as described.\nForeseeable loss. Except as set out in No Limitation above, if we fail to comply with these Terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of these Terms or our negligence, but we (and our Providers) are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if it was an obvious consequence of our breach or if it was contemplated by you and us at the time that you accessed our Services, or if you have a Subscription, at the time that the agreement between you and us related to your Subscription become binding (i.e., when the confirmation email for that Subscription was issued).\n\nNon-commercial use only. You agree not to use our Services for any commercial or business purposes and we (and our Providers) have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.\n\nYour rights. Nothing in these Terms affects your statutory rights and we are under a legal duty to provide you with Services that are in conformity with the terms applying to your Subscription. Advice about your statutory rights is available from your local Citizens\u2019 Advice Bureau or Trading Standards Office (or local equivalent).\n\nLimitation of liability. Except as otherwise set out in this Section 10, our total liability to you for any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with these Terms, whether in contract (including under any indemnity), tort (including negligence) or otherwise will be limited to the greater of: (a) the amount you paid to us for access to or use of the Services in the six months prior to the event giving rise to the liability, and (b) \u00a3100.\n\nBeneficiaries. Our Providers may benefit from, and enforce, their rights under this Section 10.\n\n12. General terms\nChanges to the Services. Our Services are novel and will change. We may sometimes add or remove features, increase or decrease capacity limits, offer new Services, or stop offering old ones. We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services or your access to the Services. Where those actions will materially impact your use of the Services, we will endeavor to notify you in accordance with this section. This includes taking such action as we consider appropriate to address any security, performance or trust and safety issue.\n\nWhere feasible, we will provide you with at least 30 days\u2019 advance notice of any such changes to the Services that would materially limit or reduce the features, availability or functionality of the Services. However, there may be urgent situations (such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues) where providing advance notice is not feasible.\n\nIf you do not wish to continue using the Services following material changes to the Services, please cancel your Account (or the Subscription purchased via our website, if applicable) by notifying us at support@anthropic.com and we will refund you a portion of the fees paid by you that are for the portion of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining after termination of your Subscription occurs. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor\u2019s terms and not these terms.\n\nChanges to the Terms. \ufeff\ufeffWe may revise and update these Terms. For example, we may update these Terms (1) to reflect changes in our Services, like when we add or remove features or services, or update our pricing, (2) for security or legal reasons, or (3) to promote safety or prevent abuse. We will notify you of changes to the Terms which are reasonably likely to affect your use of the Services or legal rights. These changes will come into effect no less than 30 days from when we notify you, unless the change is due to a change in law or for security reasons (in which case we may need to change the Terms on shorter notice).\n\nIf you do not wish to continue using our Services following any changes to the Terms you can terminate these Terms (or a Subscription purchased via our website) by notifying us at support@anthropic.com, before the changes take effect. If you exercise this termination right, we will refund to you a portion of the fees paid by you that are for the portion of your Subscription purchased via our website remaining after termination of your Subscription occurs. Any refunds for Subscriptions purchased via an App Distributor are subject to the App Distributor\u2019s terms and not these Terms.\n\nSupplemental terms. We may offer new Services or features that we believe require service-specific terms or guidelines. If you decide to use those new Services or features, you agree to comply with any applicable guidelines, rules, or supplemental terms that may be posted on the Services from time to time (\u201cSupplemental Terms\u201d). If these Terms conflict with Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will govern for the applicable Service.\n\nEntire agreement. These Terms and any other terms expressly incorporated by reference form the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of our Terms.\n\nTermination. You may stop accessing the Services at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time without notice to you if:\n\nwe believe that you have materially breached these Terms;\nwe must do so in order to comply with applicable law; or\nimmediate suspension or termination is necessary for security reasons and therefore we cannot provide notice.\nWe may also terminate your Account if you have been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid Account. If we decide to terminate your Account due to inactivity, we will give you advance notice before doing this.\n\nIf we terminate your access to the Services due to a material violation of these Terms and you have a Subscription:\n\nyou will not be entitled to any refund; and\nwe may take further legal action against you and you may be responsible for our losses in relation to the violation of these Terms.\nIf you have a Subscription, we may terminate the Subscription immediately at any time by giving you 30 days\u2019 notice in writing (email is sufficient). If we exercise this right, we will refund you on a pro rata basis the fees paid by you for the remaining portion of your Subscription after termination.\n\nUpon termination of these Terms, a Subscription, or your access to the Services, the rights granted to you under our Terms (or any Subscription) to access and use our Services will immediately terminate, and we may at our option delete any Materials or other data associated with your account. Sections 6 (with respect to fees outstanding as of such expiration or termination) and 9 \u2013 12 will survive any expiration or termination of our Terms or a Subscription.\n\nSeverability. Each of the sections of these Terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining sections will remain in full force and effect.\n\nNo waiver. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these Terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.\n\nNo assignment. These Terms may not be transferred or assigned by you without our prior written consent, but may be assigned by us without restriction.\n\nUse of our brand. You may not, without our prior written permission, use our name, logos, or other trademarks in connection with products or services other than the Services, or in any other way that implies our affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship.

These encompass platforms with generative artificial intelligence services at their core, among other functionalities (hereinafter referred to as \"the Services\").\n\n \n\n1.2 The generative AI products and services provided by DeepSeek are based on large language models, which are built using neural network, developed through stages of large-scale self-supervised pre-training and targeted optimization training. These models can predict the next token by encoding and computing the input information (including text, images, files, and more), thereby possessing text generation and conversational abilities. They are adept at performing a wide range of text generation tasks and can be integrated into various downstream systems or applications. Specifically, within DeepSeek's product services, these models, based on user input information (referred to as \"Inputs\"), compute and infer to output corresponding content as a response (referred to as \"Outputs\" ), including text, tables, and code. Users can evaluate the output, including actions like liking or disliking, to provide feedback on their opinions about DeepSeek's output information.\n\n \n\n1.3 As generative artificial intelligence technology, models, and products continue to evolve, along with changes in laws and regulations, we may add, upgrade, modify, suspend, or terminate services, or make necessary adjustments to the technology, method, and performance of the services, and may conduct internal or external testing for new service features.

Disclaimers\nYour use of our Services, Beta Services and any content or materials provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) is at your sole risk. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, our Services, Beta Services and any content or materials provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) are provided \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cas available\u201d without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. ElevenLabs disclaims all warranties with respect to the foregoing, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. In addition, ElevenLabs does not represent or warrant that our Services, Beta Services or any content provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free or that access to our Services, Beta Services or any content provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) will be uninterrupted. While ElevenLabs attempts to make your use of our Services, Beta Services and any content provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) safe, we cannot and do not represent or warrant that our Services, Beta Services or any content provided therein or therewith (including the Third-Party Content and Third-Party Services) are free of viruses or other harmful components or content or materials.

Due to the nature of machine learning, the Output generated by you using the Services may not be unique across users, as the Services may produce the same or similar Output for you and a third party. Two different parties may receive the same or similar Output after submitting their respective Inputs. Responses requested by and generated for other users that are not you shall not be considered Output for you, and you shall have no right or title over it.\n\n11. Limitation of Liability\n(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, ElevenLabs will not be liable to you under any theory of liability (whether based in contract, tort, negligence, warranty, or otherwise) for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, punitive, or special damages or lost profits, even if ElevenLabs has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n(b) The total liability of ElevenLabs for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of the form of the action, is limited to the greater of: (i) One Hundred United States Dollars ($100 USD); and (ii) the amount paid by you to use our Services in the 12 months preceding the claim.\n\n12. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration\nPlease read this Section 12 carefully because it requires you and ElevenLabs to arbitrate certain disputes and claims and limits the manner in which we can seek relief from each other. Arbitration precludes you and ElevenLabs from suing in court or having a jury trial. You and ElevenLabs agree that arbitration will be solely on an individual basis and not as a class arbitration, class action, or any other kind of representative proceeding. ElevenLabs and you are each waiving the right to trial by a jury.Follow the instructions below if you wish to opt out of the requirement of arbitration on an individual basis. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration agreement.\n\n(a) Informal Dispute Resolution Prior to Arbitration. For any dispute or claim between you and ElevenLabs arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Services or these Terms and prior versions of these Terms, including claims and disputes that arose between you and us before the effective date of these Terms, or any privacy or data security claims, (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d, and each a \u201cDispute\u201d), you and ElevenLabs agree to attempt to first resolve the Claim informally via the following process:\n\nIf you assert a Dispute against ElevenLabs, you will first contact ElevenLabs by sending a written notice of your Dispute to ElevenLabs by email to legal@elevenlabs.io. If ElevenLabs asserts a Dispute against you, ElevenLabs will contact you by sending a written notice of ElevenLabs\u2019 Dispute to you via email to the primary email address associated with your account.\nIf you and ElevenLabs cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within 30 days after you or ElevenLabs receives the applicable notice, then either party may submit the Dispute to binding arbitration as set forth below. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for thirty (30) days from the date that either you or ElevenLabs first send the applicable notice so that the parties can engage in this informal dispute-resolution process.\n(b) Disputes Subject to Binding Arbitration; Exceptions. Except for individual disputes that qualify for small claims court and any disputes exclusively related to the intellectual property or intellectual property rights of you or ElevenLabs, including any disputes in which you or ElevenLabs seek injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of your or ElevenLabs\u2019 intellectual property or other infringement of your or ElevenLabs\u2019 intellectual property rights (\u201cIP Disputes\u201d), all Disputes, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, that are not resolved in accordance with Section 12(a) will be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration instead of in a court by a judge or jury. The arbitration shall be administered by Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\u201cJAMS\u201d) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in court. The remedies and reliefs rendered by the arbitrator may be confirmed and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.\n\nA party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the \u201cRequest\u201d). The Request must include: (i) the name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number of the party seeking arbitration and the email address associated with any applicable account; (ii) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (iii) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States dollars; (iv) a statement certifying completion of the informal dispute resolution process as described in Section 12(a) above; and (v) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.\n\nIf the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include such counsel\u2019s name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel\u2019s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (A) the Request is not being presented for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (B) the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a non-frivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (C) the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. \n\nYou and ElevenLabs agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties\u2019 attorneys, accountants, or authorized representatives, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings strictly confidential. \n\n(c) Opting Out of Arbitration. You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you first accepted these Terms by providing us with notice of your decision to opt-out via email or by certified mail to the applicable address set out below. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your full name, mailing address, and email address. The notice must also clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with Section 12.\n\nEleven Labs Inc.\nAttn: Legal Department \u2013 Arbitration Opt-Out\n169 Madison Ave #2484\nNew York, NY 10016\nLegal@elevenlabs.io\n(d) Rejection of Future Arbitration Changes. You may reject any change we make to Section 12 (except address changes) by personally signing and sending us notice within 30 days of the change by certified mail addressed to: \n\nEleven Labs Inc.\nAttn: Legal Department \u2013 Arbitration Opt-Out\n169 Madison Ave #2484\nNew York, NY 10016\nIf you do, the most recent version of Section 12 before the change you rejected will apply.\n\n(e) Severability. If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, including but not limited to because it is found to be unconscionable, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision will be severed from these Terms; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision will have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties\u2019 ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 12; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The litigation of those claims will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be enforceable.\n\n(f) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND ELEVENLABS HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and ElevenLabs are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under these Terms, except as specified in Section 12(b). \n\n(g) Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND ELEVENLABS AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12(h), EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Section 12, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party\u2019s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 12(h). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this Section are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, you and ElevenLabs agree that the particular claim or request for relief, and only that particular claim or request for relief, shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of New York. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This Section does not prevent you or ElevenLabs from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n\n(h) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and ElevenLabs agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against ElevenLabs by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall: (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (ii) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (iii) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (\u201cBatch Arbitration\u201d).\n\nAll parties agree that Requests are of a \u201csubstantially similar nature\u201d if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (\u201cAdministrative Arbitrator\u201d). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator\u2019s fees shall be paid by ElevenLabs. \n\nYou and ElevenLabs agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.   \n\n13. Governing Law\nAny Claims will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, except to the extent preempted by U.S. Federal Law, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. If any Claim is not subject to arbitration pursuant to Section 12, then the state and federal courts located in New York City, New York, will have exclusive jurisdiction. You and ElevenLabs waive any objection to venue in any such courts. If your local law requires that consumer contracts be interpreted subject to local law and enforced in the courts of that jurisdiction, this section may not apply to you only to the extent that local law conflicts with this section.\n\n14. Modifying and Terminating Our Services\nWe may: (a) modify, impose limits on, replace, upgrade, update, suspend, or terminate providing all or part of our Services at any time; (b) charge, modify, or waive any fees required to use the Services; or (c) offer opportunities to some or all end users of the Services, each of (a) through (c) without any liability or additional notice to you. All modifications and additions to the Services will be governed by the Terms or Supplemental Terms, unless otherwise expressly stated by ElevenLabs in writing. We are not responsible for any loss or harm related to your inability to access or use our Services.\n\n15. Export Control\nYou are responsible for compliance with United States export controls and for any violation of such controls, including any United States embargoes or other federal rules and regulations restricting exports. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country or territory that is subject to economic sanctions or trade embargoes imposed by the U.S. Government (including Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, and the annexed regions of Ukraine), that you are not listed on identified on any U.S. Government list of sanctioned individuals, that you will comply fully with all relevant export laws and regulations of the United States and other international trade laws applicable to your use of the Services.\n\n16. Miscellaneous\n(a) ElevenLabs\u2019 failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms reflect the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations, statements, and understandings of the parties. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.

URLs are understood to also refer to successor URLs, URLs for localized content, and information or resources linked from within the websites at the specified URLs.

You may also contact us by writing to:\n\nEleven Labs Inc.\n169 Madison Ave #2484\nNew York, NY 10016\nnote that email communications will not necessarily be secure; accordingly, you should not include payment card information or other sensitive information in your email correspondence with us.

The license granted to you is limited to a non-transferable license to use the Mobile App on any iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, or any other Apple device that you own or control as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service.\n\n(iii) Maintenance and Support.

You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for any product warranties, whether express or implied by law, with respect to the Mobile App. In the event of any failure of the Mobile App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price, if any, paid to Apple for the Mobile App by you; and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Mobile App. The parties acknowledge that to the extent that there are any applicable warranties, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any such applicable warranty would be the sole responsibility of ElevenLabs. However, ElevenLabs has disclaimed all warranties of any kind with respect to the Mobile App, and therefore, there are no warranties applicable to the Mobile App.\n\n(v) Product Claims.

Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.\n\n(b) Google Play Store. The following terms apply if you download our Mobile App from Google Play (or its successors) operated by Google, Inc. or one of its affiliates (\u201cGoogle\u201d).\n\n(i) Google Play Terms.

Any refund, payments, or credits which ElevenLabs must provide to you in accordance with the terms of this Agreement will be provided by ElevenLabs to Reseller, and you acknowledge that you must seek such refunds, payments, and credits from Reseller only. Furthermore, your right to terminate or cancel its Service is solely as described in the Reseller Agreement, provided that nothing herein shall be interpreted as permitting Reseller to offer terms inconsistent with the remainder of this Agreement. If the Reseller ceases at any time to be an authorized Reseller, including for a failure to pay for any Services, your continued use of Services may be conditioned upon you executing a written agreement for such Services directly with ElevenLabs, and paying the outstanding Fees, if any, that Reseller did not remit to ElevenLabs on your behalf. Resellers are not authorized to modify the Agreement or make any promises or commitments on ElevenLabs\u2019s behalf, and ElevenLabs is not bound by any obligations to you other than as set forth in this Agreement. ElevenLabs may temporarily suspend or terminate delivery of Services to you in accordance with these Terms."

TEAL MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE, AND SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, AND FITNESS FORA PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE,OR TRADE PRACTICE. THE SERVICE AND THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"ASIS.\" TEAL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES WILL SATISFY YOUR REQUIREMENTS, ARE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED.\n\nTEAL CANNOT AND DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGES OR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE FAILURE OF ANY TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE, OR THE INTERNET OR FOR YOUR MISUSE OF ANY CONTENT AND INFORMATION ACCESSED THROUGH THE SERVICE. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND YOUR RELIANCE UPON ANY OF THE RESPECTIVE CONTENT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.\n\n\u200d\n\nSome jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of warranties, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.\n\n\u200d\n\n12. Indemnification\n\n\u200d\n\nDefense. At Teal's option and request, you will defend Teal, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, and contractors (the \"Teal Parties\") from any actual or threatened third-party claim, proceeding, or suit arising out of or based on (1) your breach of any representation, warranty, or covenant in these Terms, (2) use of the Service in a manner not authorized under these Terms, (3) any and all claims and actions against Teal by other parties to whom you allow access to the Service (each, a \"Claim\").\n\n\u200d\n\nIndemnification.

Dispute Resolution\n\n\u200d\n\nGenerally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Teal in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and Teal agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to these Terms or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the expiration or termination of theseTerms.\n\n\u200d\n\nYOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT,BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND TEAL ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO ATRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION. YOU FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TERMS WILL APPLY TO YOU AND TEAL UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO OPT OUT PURSUANT TO THE OPT OUT SECTION BELOW.\n\n\u200d\n\nExceptions. Despite the provisions above, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (1) bring an individual action in small claims court; (2) bring an action in a court pursuant to the California Private Attorneys General Act of 2004, California Labor Code Section 2698 et seq.; (3) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (4) file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.\n\n\u200d\n\nArbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Teal will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Teal.\n\n\u200d\n\nNotice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period (\"Notice\"). Teal's email address for Notice is hello@tealhq.com. The Notice must: (1)describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (2) set forth the specific relief sought; and (3) if you are sending the Notice to Teal, include your name and address (\"Demand\"). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 45 days after the Notice is received, you or Teal may commence an arbitration proceeding.\n\n\u200d\n\nFees; Location. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, Teal will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Miami, Florida, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address.\n\n\u200d\n\nNo Class Actions. YOUAND TEAL AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING (OTHER THAN ACTIONS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT OF 2004, CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE SECTION 2698 ETSEQ. WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY THIS SECTION). Unless both you and Teal agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\n\u200d\n\nModifications to this Arbitration Provision. If Teal makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to Teal's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Teal's address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and Teal.\n\n\u200d\n\nEnforceability. If theNo Class Actions section is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section will be null and void and the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in the Governing Law section will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms or your use of the Service.\n\n\u200d\n\nOpt Out. Arbitration is not a mandatory condition of these Terms. If you do not want to be subject to this Dispute Resolution section, you may opt out by notifying Teal in writing of your decision by sending, within 30 days of the date you receive these Terms, an email to hello@tealhq.com, stating clearly your full name, address, and intent to opt out of this Dispute Resolution section. Should you choose not to opt out within the 30-day period, you and Teal will be bound by the terms of this Dispute Resolution section. You have the right to consult with counsel of your choice concerning this section.\n\n\u200d\n\n15. Miscellaneous\n\n\u200d\n\nGoverning Law. These Terms are governed by Delaware law without reference to its conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to these Terms. Subject to the Dispute Resolution section, all claims arising under these Terms will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Delaware. The parties submit to the jurisdiction in those courts. In any proceeding to enforce rights under these Terms, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n\u200d\n\nAssignment. You may not assign these Terms or delegate your performance without Teal's prior written consent, and any attempt to do so is void. Teal may assign or transfer these Terms without your consent. These Terms are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties' permitted successors and assigns.\n\n\u200d\n\nSeverability. If any provision of these Terms or portion of a provision is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the rest of these Terms will remain in effect.\n\n\u200d\n\nNo Waiver. Neither party will be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under these Terms.\n\n\u200d\n\nEntire Agreement. TheseTerms constitute the entire agreement and supersede any other agreement of the parties relating to their subject matter.\n\n\u200d\n\nNo Third-Party Beneficiaries. There are no third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, except as described in the Notice Regarding Apple section.\n\nNotices. All notices under these Terms must be in writing, and will be considered given: (1) upon delivery, if delivered personally or by internationally recognized courier service; (2) three business days after being sent, if delivered by U.S. registered or certified mail (return receipt requested); or (3) upon acknowledgement of receipt, if delivered by email. All notices to Teal will be sent to hello@tealhq.com.\n\n\u200d\n\nForce Majeure. Teal will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform under these Terms as a result of any cause or condition beyond Teal's reasonable control (a \"Force Majeure Event\"), so long as Teal uses reasonable efforts to avoid or remove those causes of delay or non-performance.\n\n\u200d\n\n16. Notice for California Users\n\n\u200d\n\nUnder California Civil Code Section 1789.3, Teal Users located in California are entitled to the following notice: The Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs may be contacted in writing at400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, California 95814, or by telephone at (916) 445-1254 or (800) 952-5210.\n\n\u200d\n\n17. Notice Regarding Apple\n\n\u200d\n\nThis Section only applies to the extent you are using the Service on an iOS device. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Teal only, not with Apple Inc. (\"Apple\"),and Apple is not responsible for the Service or the content thereof. Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. If the Service fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the mobile application to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including: (A)product liability claims; (B) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; or (C) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

If Supplier has a legal obligation to collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible, Supplier will invoice Customer for those amounts unless Customer provides a valid tax exemption certificate.

Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and renew automatically unless you cancel before the renewal date in your account settings.

Except where required by law, subscription fees are non-refundable.\n\nCredits and Separate Balances (Optional Services)\n\nLovable Cloud and the AI Gateway run on Cloud Credits. You have two separate balances - one for Lovable Cloud and one for the AI Gateway. Cloud Credits are consumed as you use those Services and are in addition to any Platform subscription fees.\n\nFree vs. Paid Credits\n\nFree Credits: We may grant Free Credits (for example, $25/month for Lovable Cloud and $1/month for the AI Gateway).\nPaid Credits: You can buy Paid Credits anytime.

Upon plan change, cancellation, or downgrade, rollover credits are subject to forfeiture as described in the \"Refunds and Termination\" section.\nBuying Credits and Auto-Reload\n\nYou may purchase Credits through Stripe or another third-party payment processor that we designate from time to time. By purchasing Credits, you agree to be bound by the applicable terms and conditions of the payment processor in addition to these Terms. You may also enable auto-reload so that your balance is automatically replenished when it falls below a threshold you select. We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of our designated payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.\n\nInvoices and Records\n\nWe issue monthly invoices that show: (a) your Platform subscription charges (if any), and (b) your usage by Service (Lovable Cloud vs. AI Gateway). Invoices are generated based on the records of our designated third-party payment processor (such as Stripe). We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of that payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.\n\nNo Refunds; Not a Financial Instrument\n\nCredits are prepaid, non-refundable, and non-redeemable for cash or any other value.

For rollover and expiration rules, see the \"Credit Rollover and Expiration\" section above. For forfeiture rules, see the \"Refunds and Termination\" section.\n\nMetering and Third-Party Dependencies\n\nWe use reasonable efforts to meter usage accurately, but metering depends on third-party services (including Stripe, Supabase, and Third-Party AI Providers).

These include Infrastructure Providers for Lovable Cloud and Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter) for the AI Gateway. Because we do not fully control these providers, we cannot guarantee the uninterrupted availability, performance, or security of the Services. You understand and agree that interruptions, delays, or errors may occur, and that we will not be responsible for issues caused by those providers or by events beyond our reasonable control (including force majeure events).\n\nAI Use Disclaimer\nThe Services may use artificial intelligence models to generate code, content, or other outputs (\"AI Output\"). AI Output may contain errors, inaccuracies, or other issues and should not be relied upon without independent review and testing. You are solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and using any AI Output, whether it is generated through:\n\nour Platform\u2019s integrated AI;\nthe AI Gateway (via Third-Party AI Providers such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter); or\nany model or API that you connect to the Services.\nYou assume full responsibility for your use of AI Output and agree not to rely on it for critical or high-risk functions (including medical, legal, financial, or safety-related purposes) without appropriate safeguards.

Our Services are not designed to handle that type of data, and we disclaim all responsibility if you choose to submit it.\n\nUse of Infrastructure and AI Providers\nThe Services, including the Platform, Lovable Cloud, and the AI Gateway, run in part on Infrastructure Providers (for example, Supabase and other hosting or database providers). In addition, the Platform and the AI Gateway both transmit your inputs, prompts, and related data to artificial intelligence systems, including large language models and other machine learning models, in order to generate code, content, or other outputs. These systems may be provided by us, by Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter), or by models that you connect yourself. By using the Services, you consent to these transfers, processing, and storage.\n\nRights in Customer Data\nExcept for PII, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, process, analyze, and otherwise exploit your Customer Data for our business purposes, including without limitation:\n\noperating, maintaining, and improving the Services;\ndeveloping and training artificial intelligence and machine learning models;\ncreating benchmarks, analytics, and insights; and\nany other lawful business purpose.\nIf you do not want your Customer Data used for model training or other business purposes, you may opt out by contacting us or by upgrading to a Business plan that provides enhanced data-handling controls.\n\nUse of PII\nWe will not use raw or identifiable PII for model training.

If you cancel your account/Services, the remaining Credits will remain available until the end of billing period. If we terminate your account/Services for any reason other than your breach of the Terms (including for security, legal, or other reasons not attributable to you), any remaining Credits will be applied to fees owed through the effective date of termination, after which they will expire.\n\nNo Refunds\n\nExcept where required by law, all fees are non-refundable.\n\nEffect of Termination\n\nTermination of your account or these Terms ends your right to access the Services, but does not affect any rights or obligations that, by their nature, should continue (for example, intellectual property rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and payment obligations).\n\nMarketing and Promotions\nPromotional Credits and Offers\nFrom time to time, we may provide you with promotional credits or other promotional offers, such as free access to the AI Gateway for a limited period.

Return and Deletion\nUpon termination of the Agreement, Lovable shall immediately discontinue all processing of Customer Personal Data, other than secure storage or any processing expressly permitted under DPA.\nWithin thirty (30) calendar days after the termination of the Agreement the Customer may instruct Lovable, in writing, to return or delete all Customer Personal Data then in Lovable's possession or control, unless Applicable Data Protection Laws require storage of the Customer Personal Data.\nIf no such instruction is received within thirty (30) calendar days, Lovable may, at its discretion, permanently delete or irreversibly anonymize the Customer Personal Data in accordance with its documented retention schedule.\nWhere manual data-export or bespoke deletion work exceeds two (2) person-hours, Lovable may charge the Customer its reasonable, documented costs at the then-current professional-services rates, except to the extent such charges are prohibited by Applicable Data Protection Laws.\nThe provisions of this Section, together with Sections 12 (Governing Law and Jurisdiction) and 14 (Limitation of Liability), shall survive termination of DPA for so long as Lovable retains any Customer Personal Data.\n12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction\nThis DPA, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Terms of Service.\n\n13.

Lovable will give prompt written notice and reasonable cooperation; the Customer may control the defense but may not settle any matter that admits fault or imposes non-monetary obligations on Lovable without Lovable's prior written consent.\nFurther, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the Customer releases and will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Lovable from any claim, fine, or loss arising out of the Customer's failure to implement or maintain the security controls described in this DPA.\n14. Liability\nThe Parties' liability under this DPA shall be limited in accordance with the provisions of the General Terms and Conditions.\nThe Parties acknowledge and agree that neither Party shall have an obligation to indemnify the other Party for any administrative fines imposed by a supervisory authority or a court under Applicable Data Protection Legislation.\nIn no event shall either Party be liable to the other for any loss of profits, revenue, goodwill, business interruption, loss or corruption of data, or for any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages of any kind, even if advised of the possibility of such loss or damage and regardless of the theory of liability. The foregoing limitations and exclusions apply (i) in the aggregate across this DPA and the Agreement, (ii) irrespective of the number or nature of claims, and (iii) notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.\n15. US Privacy Laws\nTo the extent Lovable's Processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement is subject to U.S. Privacy Laws:\nThe Parties acknowledge that Lovable's retention, use and disclosure of Customer Personal Data authorized by the Customer's instructions stated in this Agreement are integral to the Lovable Services and the business relationship between the Parties.\nLovable shall:\nUse, retain, and disclose Customer Personal Data only as necessary to perform the business purposes specified in this Agreement or as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws;\nComply with applicable obligations under U.S. Privacy Laws and shall provide the same level of privacy protection as is required of a \"service provider\" or \"contractor\" under each applicable U.S. Privacy Law;\nImplement reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, access, use, or disclosure;\nNotify the Customer without undue delay if Lovable determines it cannot meet its obligations under U.S. Privacy Laws;\nCooperate with the Customer to stop and remediate any unauthorized use of Customer Personal Data.\nLovable shall not:\nSell or share any Customer Personal Data\nRetain, use or disclose any Customer Personal Data for any purpose other than for the business purposes specified in the Agreement, including retaining, using, or disclosing the Customer Personal Data for a commercial purpose other than the business purposes specified in the Agreement or as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws\nCombine the Customer Personal Data received from the Customer with Customer Personal Data received from or on behalf another person, or Customer Personal Data Lovable collects from its own interaction with the consumer, except as otherwise permitted by U.S. Privacy Laws\nDe-identify or aggregate Customer Personal Data unless the de-identification meets U.S. Privacy Laws, and the output cannot be re-identified.\n16.

        "loveable-privacy-policy.txt": "https://lovable.dev/privacy\nPrivacy Policy\nLast Updated: September 29, 2025\n\nLovable Labs Incorporated (\"Lovable,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an AI-powered platform dedicated to empowering developers and non-technical users to build, share, and deploy web applications using natural language prompts. Our mission is to simplify software development through innovative tools, seamless integrations, and collaborative features, while prioritizing the privacy and security of your data. We are committed to fostering a vibrant developer community and ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws in the United States (including all applicable state privacy statutes), European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Canada.\n\nThis Privacy Policy (\"Policy\"), available online at https://www.lovable.dev/privacy, outlines how Lovable collects, uses, shares, and otherwise processes personal information from users, including developers, entrepreneurs, and visitors (\"User,\" \"you,\" or \"your\") of our website, platform, and services (collectively, our \"Services\"). By using our Services, you acknowledge this Policy; our legal basis for processing may include contract performance, legitimate interests, or legal obligations, as set out in Section 3. This Policy incorporates our Terms of Service and any applicable Data Processing Agreement (DPA) by reference. You may view our Data Processing Agreement at www.lovable.dev/data-processing-agreement. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please discontinue your use of our Services. Existing users with contractual obligations should contact us to discuss applicable terms. In the event of any conflict between this Policy and a signed DPA, the DPA will control with respect to Customer Personal Data\n\nPersonal Data: For purposes of this Policy, \"personal data\" (also called \"personal information\" under the California Consumer Privacy Act/Privacy Rights Act and similar U.S. state laws) means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person or is reasonably capable of being linked to a particular consumer or household, as set out in the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, Canada's PIPEDA, the revised Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, and all applicable U.S. federal or state privacy statutes. Personal data may include, for example, your name, business email address, postal address, telephone number, username, unique device or browser identifiers, Internet-protocol (IP) address, authentication tokens, usage and telemetry logs, or other information generated through your use of our Services. Personal data also includes biometric, genetic, and special category data as defined under GDPR and international equivalents. Operational metrics and telemetry that Lovable processes independently for security, billing, analytics, or product-improvement purposes (\"Service Data\") are handled separately as described in Section 8 and are not treated as Customer Personal Data.\nLovable does not intentionally collect special-category or sensitive personal data, such as biometric identifiers, health information, or precise geolocation, and instructs customers not to upload such information. This definition will be interpreted to include any equivalent term under other privacy laws that come into force during the life of this Policy.\n\nCollection and Use of Information:\nInformation You Provide Directly: When you create an account, purchase a subscription, open a support ticket, or otherwise use our Services, you may supply personal data such as your name, business-email address, phone number, payment information (processed via Stripe; see Stripe's privacy policy at stripe.com/privacy for details on how they handle your card details and transaction data). For usage-based services like Lovable Cloud and AI Gateway, we collect and process Usage Data (e.g., API calls, storage usage, prompt volumes) to meter consumption against your Credits (prepaid balances). These Credits are tracked in separate balances per service, with metering reliant on Stripe and third-party providers. We do not store full payment card details; Stripe serves as the source of truth for billing records, which may include anonymized usage metrics shared with us for invoicing, and project artefacts (for example, natural-language prompts, code snippets, or deployment configurations). These artifacts are used only to serve your workspace and, once anonymized or aggregated, to improve our models; they are never used to train general-purpose AI models that benefit other customers without your permission.\nInformation Collected Automatically: When you interact with the Services, we automatically collect technical data such as IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, pages visited, timestamps, and error logs. Certain operational metrics and telemetry (\"Service Data\") are processed by Lovable as an independent controller for security, billing, analytics, and product-improvement purposes (see Section 10). Billing and Metering Data: Telemetry on service usage (e.g., compute hours in Lovable Cloud, API requests via AI Gateway) is collected to generate monthly invoices showing consumption by service. This data is anonymized where possible and shared with Stripe for payment processing and revenue recognition.\nUsage and Analytics Data: We record how you engage with key features (e.g., prompts submitted, code generated, build and deployment events, clicks on the GitHub or Supabase integrations). If you authorize a third-party integration, Lovable accesses only the minimum data required to provide that integration and processes it under the same terms as other Customer Personal Data.\nData Handling in Lovable Cloud and AI Gateway: Lovable Cloud provides cloud hosting and back-end services (e.g., database, authentication, storage), where your Customer Data (as defined in our Terms of Service), including hosted applications, files, and generated outputs, is stored and processed on Supabase infrastructure. By using Lovable Cloud, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your Customer Data by Supabase under their privacy policy (available at supabase.com/privacy). The AI Gateway acts as a proxy to connect your applications to third-party AI providers, including OpenAI, Google Gemini, and models via OpenRouter. When using the AI Gateway, your inputs (e.g., prompts, queries) and related Customer Data are transmitted to these providers for processing and response generation. These transmissions occur on a pass-through basis; we do not store the raw prompts or responses unless you explicitly save them in your workspace. By using the AI Gateway, you consent to such transfers under the privacy policies of OpenRouter (openrouter.ai/privacy), OpenAI (openai.com/policies/privacy-policy), and Google (policies.google.com/privacy). We do not control these providers' data practices, and you are responsible for reviewing their policies.\nChildren's Data: Lovable's Services are not intended for individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under this age.

Lovable safeguards these transfers through the following legally recognized mechanisms:\nEU\u2013US Data Privacy Framework (DPF): When eligible, Lovable relies first on its DPF certification (and the UK and Swiss Extensions) for transfers from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland to the United States.\nEU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs): Module 2 (Controller-to-Processor) per Commission Decision 2021/914, incorporated into our DPAs.\nUK International Data Transfer Addendum: Version B1.0, issued by the UK ICO under s119A DPA 2018.\nSwiss Addendum: Adapts the SCCs to the revised Swiss FADP, naming the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) as the competent authority.\nInvestigations: Lovable may investigate and disclose information, as permitted by law, if we believe in good faith that such action is:\nNecessary to comply with a valid legal process or governmental request (e.g., subpoena, court order, or law-enforcement demand) and, unless legally prohibited, Lovable will notify the affected customer before producing data, consistent with our SCC and DPA obligations.\nHelpful to prevent, investigate, or identify fraud, security incidents, or other wrongdoing in connection with our Services.\nNecessary to protect our rights, reputation, property, or those of our users, affiliates, or the public.\nDisclosures will comply with applicable privacy laws and be limited to what is necessary.\n\nLog Data: When you use our Services, Lovable automatically collects operational telemetry (\"Log Data\") that helps us secure and improve the platform. Log Data may include:\nYour device's IP address and approximate location\nBrowser type and version.\nPages, APIs, or features you access within the Services.\nTimestamps and time spent on specific screens or functions.\nUnique session or device identifiers and error/debugging codes.\nOther usage statistics.\nLog data is retained for up to ninety (90) days, unless required by law, to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and improve user experience.\n\nCookies and Other Tracking: Lovable and selected third-party partners use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (\"Cookies\") to operate, secure, and analyze our Services. We deploy four types of Cookies:\nStrictly Necessary Cookies support core functions such as sign-in, session routing, fraud prevention, and consent storage. These are set on the basis of legitimate interests / contract performance and do not require consent.\nAnalytics & Performance Cookies measure feature adoption, diagnose errors, track user interactions, and improve service performance. We use first-party analytics (PostHog) and third-party services (Google Analytics, TikTok) for these purposes. We obtain prior consent for these Cookies in the EEA/UK/CH and honor CPRA \"opt-out\" signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control) in the United States.\nFunctional Cookies remember your preferences (language, theme, layout) and are configurable in the in-product \"Cookie Settings\" panel.\nMarketing Cookies enable conversion tracking and campaign measurement through third-party services including Tiktok, Facebook/Meta, and Google Ads. While we use these cookies to measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, we do not \"sell\" or \"share\" Customer Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising as defined under applicable privacy laws.

If you believe your account information is inaccurate, contact us as set out in Section 16 and we will correct it promptly. We implement reasonable security measures (e.g., encryption in transit/rest, access controls) to protect your personal data, but our Services rely on third-party providers like Supabase (for Lovable Cloud), OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter (for AI Gateway). We cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability, security, or performance of these providers, and data interruptions, delays, or losses may occur due to their actions or events beyond our control (including force majeure). For Lovable Cloud, certain provisioned resources may not be immediately terminable via API; you remain responsible for any data hosted there until fully decommissioned. In cases of misuse or abuse (e.g., excessive data uploads causing cost spikes), you agree to indemnify us for related privacy or security claims arising from third-party provider interactions, as detailed in our Terms of Service. We use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of material security incidents involving your data but disclaim liability for third-party failures.\n\nRetention of Your Information: We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy or as required by applicable law, including:\nProviding and improving our Services.\nComplying with legal and regulatory obligations.\nResolving disputes or enforcing agreements. Customer data is retained for up to ninety (90) days, unless required by law, after which it is deleted or isolated. To cancel your account or request data deletion, contact us as outlined in Section 16. Upon account termination or expiration (including forfeiture of unused Credits as per the Terms), we will delete your Personal Data within 30 days, except for data required for fraud prevention, legal compliance, or legal defense purposes.

We retain Customer Data only as needed to provide the Services, with deletion available upon request (subject to backups and legal holds).\nLinks to Other Sites: Our Services may include links or integrations (for example, GitHub, Supabase, CI/CD tools, or payment providers) that are not controlled by Lovable. Your interactions with those third-party services are governed by their own privacy policies and terms. We encourage you to review those policies before providing personal data, as Lovable is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of external sites.\n\nNotice and Communications: By using the Services, you consent to receive transactional or administrative electronic communications from Lovable\u2014such as account alerts, security notifications, and billing messages. You may opt out of non-essential marketing e-mails at any time via the \"unsubscribe\" link or your account settings; this will not affect core service communications. To send formal privacy notices to Lovable, e-mail privacy@lovable.dev or post to the address in Section 16. Lovable may provide legal or privacy notices to you via e-mail, in-product banners, or any other method allowed by law.\n\nGoverning Law & Venue: This Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. However, if you are located in a jurisdiction that grants you mandatory consumer protection or data protection rights under local law, those provisions will take precedence to the extent they conflict with this Policy.

To opt out of using your Customer Data for model training, contact us at privacy@lovable.dev or upgrade to a Business plan with enhanced controls.\n\nSharing with Third Parties: We share Customer Data with Infrastructure Providers (e.g., Supabase for hosting) and Third-Party AI Providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, OpenRouter for prompt processing) as necessary to provide Services. These shares are governed by their privacy policies (linked above). We do not sell your personal data. For billing, anonymized usage data is shared with Stripe.\n\nChanges to This Policy: Lovable reserves the right to update or revise this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or the Services themselves. We will post any revised Policy at https://www.lovable.dev/privacyand indicate the \"Effective\" date at the top of the document. For material changes that reduce your rights or expand our processing purposes, we will provide at least thirty (30) days' advance notice by e-mail or in-product banner. Your continued use of the Services after the new Policy takes effect constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.\n\nSeverability: If any provision of this Policy is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable under applicable law, that provision will be interpreted to achieve its intent as closely as possible, or, if impossible, deemed severed, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.\n\nEntire Agreement: This Policy, together with the Terms of Service, the applicable Data-Processing Agreement (DPA), and any supplemental product terms, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Lovable regarding privacy and data protection in connection with the Services. In the event of a conflict, the DPA will control with respect to Customer Personal Data, followed by this Privacy Policy, then the Terms of Service.\n\nView our Cookie Policy and opt-out of non-essential cookies here: www.lovable.dev/cookie-policy\n\nView our Data Processing Agreement here: www.lovable.dev/data-processing-agreement"

Notwithstanding the applicability of these terms, if you fall under one of the exempt categories described at https://cloud.google.com/terms/direct-tos-exemptions for the applicable Services, these terms do not apply to you, unless you and Google agree otherwise in writing. If you become exempt from these terms after the Effective Date, this will not affect any liability arising between the parties prior to the date that you become exempt.\n\nIf you signed an offline variant of this Agreement for use of the Google Cloud Platform Services, Google Workspace Services, SecOps Services or Looker (original) Services under the same Google Cloud Platform Services, Google Workspace, SecOps Services or Looker (original) Services Account, the terms below do not apply to you, and your offline terms govern your use of the applicable Services.\n\nThese Google Cloud Terms of Service (together, the 'Agreement') are entered into by Google and the entity or person agreeing to these terms ('the Customer') and govern the Customer's access to and use of the Services. 'Google' has the meaning given at https://cloud.google.com/terms/google-entity.\n\nThis Agreement is effective when the Customer clicks to accept or otherwise agrees to it (the 'Effective Date'). If you are accepting on behalf of the Customer, you represent and warrant that (i) you have full legal authority to bind the Customer to this Agreement; (ii) you have read and understand this Agreement; and (iii) you agree, on behalf of the Customer, to this Agreement.\n\n1. Provision of the Services.\n\n1.1 Services use. During the Term, Google will provide the Services in accordance with this Agreement, including the SLAs, and the Customer may use the Services, and integrate the GCP Services and Looker (original) Services into any Customer Application that has material value independent of the Services, in accordance with this Agreement. For clarity, the Customer may not integrate the Google Workspace Services or SecOps Services into Customer Applications or create or host Customer Applications using the Google Workspace Services or SecOps Services under this Agreement, and the Customer may only integrate Looker (original) Services into a Customer Application as provided in the Service-Specific Terms.\n\n1.2 Admin console. If applicable, the Customer will have access to the Admin Console, through which the Customer may manage its use of the Services.\n\n1.3 Accounts; Verification to use GWS Services.\n\n(a) Accounts.

Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the Services from time to time.\n\n(b) To this Agreement. Subject to subsections (i) and (ii), Google may make updates to this Agreement from time to time. Google will post any update to this Agreement to https://cloud.google.com/terms/. This subsection 1.4(b) does not apply to updates to the URL Terms, which are governed by subsection 1.4(c) below.\n\n(i) With respect to GCP Services and their corresponding TSS, unless otherwise noted by Google, material updates to this Agreement will become effective 30 days after they are posted. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, to the extent that any updates apply to new functionality or are required to comply with applicable law, they will be effective immediately. If the Customer does not agree to any update to the Agreement regarding GCP or its TSS, the Customer may stop using the GCP Services or TSS. The Customer may also terminate this Agreement for convenience under Section 8.4 (Termination for convenience). The Customer's continued use of the GCP Services or TSS after a material update will constitute the Customer's consent to such update.\n\n(ii) With respect to GWS Services, SecOpS Services and Looker (original) Services, and their respective corresponding TSS, material updates to this Agreement will only take effect if and when the Customer's Order Term renews.\n\n(c) To the URL Terms. Google may make commercially reasonable updates to the URL Terms from time to time by posting any such update at the relevant URL Term. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material updates to the URL Terms will become effective 30 days after they have been posted.

Without limiting the generality of Section 1.4(c), Google may only update the Cloud Data Processing Addendum where such update is required to comply with applicable law or expressly permitted by the Cloud Data Processing Addendum, or where such update:\n\n(i) is commercially reasonable;\n\n(ii) does not result in a material reduction of the security of the Services;\n\n(iii) does not expand the scope of or remove any restrictions on Google's processing of 'Customer Personal Data' as described in the 'Compliance with Customer's Instructions' Section of the Cloud Data Processing Addendum; and\n\n(iv) does not otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Customer's rights under the Cloud Data Processing Addendum.\n\n(e) Discontinuation of Services. Subject to the last sentence in this Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services), Google will notify the Customer at least 12 months before:  (i) discontinuing any Service (or associated material functionality) unless Google replaces such discontinued Service or functionality with a materially similar Service or functionality; or (ii) significantly modifying a Customer-facing Google API in a backwards-incompatible manner. Nothing in this Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services) limits Google's ability to make changes required to comply with applicable law, address a material security risk, or avoid a substantial economic or material technical burden. This Section 1.4(e) (Discontinuation of Services) does not apply to pre-general availability Services, offerings or functionality.  For GWS Services, this Section 1.4(e) will only apply to Core Services and will not apply to Other Services.\n\n1.5 Software. If Google makes Software available to the Customer, including third-party software, the Customer's use of any Software is subject to the applicable provisions in the Service-Specific Terms.\n\n2. Payment terms.\n\n2.1 Billing.\n\n(a) Billing generally. Google will issue an electronic bill or invoice to the Customer for all Fees, including, if applicable, Fees based on the Customer's use of the Services during the applicable Fee Accrual Period and any relevant Fees for TSS. If Google reasonably determines based on evidence available to Google that the Customer is at risk of non-payment or that the Customer's Account is potentially fraudulent, then Google may invoice or charge the Customer more frequently. The Customer will pay all Fees in the currency stated on the bill or invoice. If the Customer pays by credit card, debit card or other non-invoiced form of payment, the Customer will pay all Fees immediately at the end of the Fee Accrual Period or when otherwise charged by Google.  If the Customer pays by invoice, the Customer will pay Google all invoiced amounts by the Payment Due Date. For GCP Services and GWS Services, the Customer may change its payment method to any other method that Google may enable, subject to acceptance by the Customer of any additional terms applicable to that payment method. Unless required by law, the Customer's obligation to pay all Fees is non-cancellable. For GCP Services, GWS Services and Looker (original) Services, Google's measurement tools will be used to determine the Customer's usage of the Services. Google has no obligation to provide multiple bills. Payments made via wire transfer must include the bank information provided by Google.\n\n(b) Billing options for GWS Services. This subsection 2.1(b) applies only to GWS Services. The Customer may elect one of the billing options below or any other option offered by Google when the Customer places its order for the Services:\n\n(i) Flexible Plan. If the Customer selects this option, the Customer will not be committed to purchase the Services for a pre-defined Term but will pay Fees based on its daily usage of the Services, billed monthly in arrears. Any partial day of Services usage will be rounded up to a full day of Services usage for the purposes of calculating Fees.\n\n(ii) Annual/Fixed-Term Plan. If the Customer selects this option, the Customer will be committed to purchasing the Services for one or more annual terms (as selected by the Customer). Google will bill the Customer according to the terms associated with the Customer's elections on the Order Form.\n\nGoogle may change its offering of billing options (including by limiting or ceasing to offer any billing option) upon 30 days' notice to the Customer and any such change will take effect at the beginning of the Customer's next Order Term. Billing options may not be available to all customers.\n\n2.2 Taxes.\n\n(a) The Customer is responsible for any Taxes, and will pay Google for the Services without any reduction for Taxes. If Google is obligated to collect or pay any Taxes, the Taxes will be invoiced to the Customer and the Customer will pay such Taxes to Google, unless the Customer provides Google with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate in respect of those Taxes.\n\n(b) The Customer will provide Google with any applicable tax identification information that Google may require under applicable law to ensure its compliance with applicable tax regulations and authorities in applicable jurisdictions. The Customer will be liable to pay (or reimburse Google for) any taxes, interest, penalties or fines arising out of any mis-declaration by the Customer.\n\n2.3 Payment disputes and refunds. Any payment disputes must be submitted in good faith before the Payment Due Date. If Google, having reviewed the dispute in good faith, determines that certain billing inaccuracies are attributable to Google, Google will not issue a corrected invoice but will instead issue a credit memo specifying the incorrect amount in the affected invoice. If a disputed invoice has not yet been paid, Google will apply the credit memo amount to a disputed invoice and the Customer will be responsible for paying the resulting net balance due on that invoice. Refunds given by Google for billing inaccuracies under this section will only be in the form of credit for the Services. Nothing in this Agreement obligates Google to extend credit to any party, and Google may revise or revoke any previously extended credit at any time.\n\n2.4 Delinquent payments; Suspension. Late payments (which, for clarity, do not include amounts subject to a good faith payment dispute submitted before the Payment Due Date), may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the Payment Due Date until paid in full. The Customer will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including lawyers' fees) incurred by Google in collecting such delinquent amounts. Furthermore, in the event of any late payment for the Services, Google may Suspend the Services.\n\n2.5 No purchase order number required. The Customer is obligated to pay all applicable Fees without any requirement for Google to provide a purchase order number on Google's invoice (or otherwise).\n\n2.6 Price revisions.

For GWS Services and Looker (original) Services only, (a) Google will notify the Customer at least 30 days in advance of any changes, and (b) The Customer's pricing will change if and when the Customer's Order Term renews after the 30-day period.

Google may provide Documentation for Customer's use of the Services.\n\n3.5 Copyright. Google responds to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminates the Accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances as required to maintain safe harbour for online service providers under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act.\n\n3.6 Third-party content enforcement (or GCP Services). If the Customer's primary use of the GCP Services is to host third-party content or facilitate the sale of goods or services between third parties on its platform, the Customer will take the following steps to enforce compliance with the AUP: (a) publish policies defining what content is prohibited on its platform (e.g. illegal content); (b) maintain a publicly accessible method (e.g. webform or email alias) to receive notices of violation of that policy (in addition to a monitored communications channel for Google); and (c) promptly review and address any such notices, and remove content where appropriate.\n\n3.7 Additional terms for GWS Services.

Any use of Third-Party Offerings is subject to separate terms and policies with the relevant service provider.\n\n(b) Administration of GWS Services. The Customer may specify through the Admin Console one or more Administrators who will have the right to access Admin Accounts. The Customer is responsible for (i) maintaining the confidentiality and security of the End User Accounts and associated passwords and (ii) any use of the End User Accounts. The Customer agrees that Google's responsibilities do not extend to the internal management or administration of the GWS Services for the Customer or any End Users.\n\n(c) Abuse monitoring. The Customer is solely responsible for monitoring, responding to and otherwise processing emails sent to the 'abuse' and 'postmaster' aliases for Customer Domain Names, but Google may monitor emails sent to these aliases to allow Google to identify GWS Services abuse.\n\n(d) Requesting additional End User Accounts during Order Term. The Customer may purchase additional End User Accounts during an Order Term by means of an additional Order Form or Reseller Order or by ordering via the Admin Console. Such additional End User Accounts will have a pro-rated term ending on the last day of the applicable Order Term.\n\n4. Suspension.\n\n4.1 AUP violations. If Google becomes aware that the Customer's or any End User's use of the Services violates the AUP, Google will notify the Customer and request that the Customer corrects the violation. If the Customer fails to correct the violation within 24 hours of Google's request, then Google may Suspend all or part of the Customer's use of the Services until the violation has been corrected. For GWS Services, Suspension of the Services may include removal or unsharing of content that violates the AUP.\n\n4.2 Other Suspension. Notwithstanding Section 4.1 (AUP violations), Google may immediately Suspend all or part of the Customer's use of the Services if (a) Google reasonably believes that Suspension is needed to protect the Services, Google's infrastructure supporting the Services or any other customer of the Services (or their end users); (b) there is suspected unauthorised third-party access to the Services; (c) Google reasonably believes that immediate Suspension is required to comply with any applicable law; or (d) the Customer is in breach of Section 3.3 (Restrictions) or the Service-Specific Terms. Google will lift any such Suspension when the circumstances giving rise to the Suspension have been resolved. At the Customer's request, Google will, unless prohibited by applicable law, notify the Customer of the basis for the Suspension as soon as is reasonably possible. For Suspension of End User Accounts for GWS Services, Google will provide the Customer's Administrator the ability to restore End User Accounts in certain circumstances.\n\n4.3 Generative AI safety and abuse for GCP Services. Google uses automated safety tools to detect abuse of Generative AI Services. Notwithstanding the 'Handling of Prompts and Generated Output' section in the Service-Specific Terms for GCP Services, if these tools detect potential abuse or violations of Google's AUP or Prohibited Use Policy, Google may log the Customer prompts solely for the purpose of reviewing and determining whether a violation has occurred. See the Abuse Monitoring documentation page for more information about how logging prompts impacts the Customer's use of the GCP Services.\n\n5.

As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google\u2019s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:\n\nWhat you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services\nWhat we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services\nContent in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services \u2014 whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others\nIn case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms\nUnderstanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times here.\n\nBesides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it\u2019s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\n\nTerms\nService provider\nGoogle services are provided by, and you\u2019re contracting with:\n\nGoogle LLC\norganized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA\n\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway\nMountain View, California 94043\nUSA\n\nAge requirements\nIf you\u2019re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian\u2019s permission to use a Google Account.

For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.\n\nWe maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons, such as to improve performance or security, to comply with law, to prevent illegal activities or abuse, to reflect technical developments, or because a feature or an entire service is no longer popular enough or economical to offer.\n\nIf we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues.

If you find that others aren\u2019t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.\n\nDon\u2019t abuse our services\nMost people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open.

If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, you can appeal.\n\nOf course, you\u2019re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you do stop using a service, we\u2019d appreciate knowing why so that we can continue improving our services.\n\nSettling disputes, governing law, and courts\nFor information about how to contact Google, please visit our contact page.\n\nIf you\u2019re a resident of, or an organization based in, the United Kingdom, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and service-specific additional terms, are governed by English law, and you can file legal disputes (including for breaches of these terms) in the English courts.\n\n\nAbout these terms\nBy law, you have certain rights that can\u2019t be limited by a contract like these terms of service.

They don\u2019t create any legal rights for other people or organizations, even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.\n\nWe want to make these terms easy to understand, so we\u2019ve used examples from our services. But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.\n\nIf it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.\n\nIf you don\u2019t follow these terms or the service-specific additional terms, and we don\u2019t take action right away, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.\n\nWe may update these terms and service-specific additional terms (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business \u2014 for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.\n\nIf we materially change these terms or service-specific additional terms, we\u2019ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don\u2019t agree to the new terms, you should remove your content and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.",
        "google-privacy-policy.txt": "https://policies.google.com/privacy\nWhen you use our services, you\u2019re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.\n\nThis Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.\n\nIf European Union or United Kingdom data protection law applies to the processing of your information, you can review the European requirements section below to learn more about your rights and Google\u2019s compliance with these laws.\n\n\nPrivacy Checkup\n\nLooking to change your privacy settings?\n\nTake the Privacy Checkup\n\nEffective December 11, 2025 | Archived versions | Download PDF\n\nWe build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:\n\nGoogle apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home\nPlatforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system\nProducts that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads, analytics, and embedded Google Maps\nYou can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you\u2019re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web in a private mode, like Chrome Incognito mode, which helps keep your browsing private from other people who use your device. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control whether we collect some types of data and how we use it.\n\nTo help explain things as clearly as possible, we\u2019ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.\n\n\nInformation Google collects\nWe want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services\nWe collect information to provide better services to all our users \u2014 from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you\u2019ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.\n\nWhen you\u2019re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you\u2019re using. This allows us to do things like maintain your preferences across browsing sessions, such as your preferred language or whether to show you more relevant search results or ads based on your activity.\n\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.\n\nThings you create or provide to us\n\nWhen you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren\u2019t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information \u2014 like an email address to communicate with Google or receive updates about our services.\n\nWe also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.\n\nInformation we collect as you use our services\nYour apps, browsers & devices\n\nWe collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.\n\nThe information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.\n\nWe collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers \u2014 for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you\u2019re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type and carrier name, crash reports, which apps you've installed, and, depending on your device settings, other information about how you\u2019re using your Android device.\n\nYour activity\n\nWe collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:\n\nTerms you search for\nVideos you watch\nViews and interactions with content and ads\nVoice and audio information\nPurchase activity\nPeople with whom you communicate or share content\nActivity on third-party sites and apps that use our services\nChrome browsing history you\u2019ve synced with your Google Account\nIf you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect call and message log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, sender and recipient email address, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types and volumes of calls and messages.\n\nYou can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that\u2019s saved in your account.\n\n\nGo to Google Account\n\nYour location information\n\nWe collect location information when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions, search results for things near you, and ads based on your location.\n\nDepending on the products you\u2019re using and settings you choose, Google may use different types of location information to help make some services and products you use more helpful. These include:\n\nGPS and other sensor data from your device\nIP address\nActivity on Google services, such as from your searches or places you label like home or work\nInformation about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices\nThe types of location data we collect and how long we store it depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device\u2019s location on or off using the device\u2019s settings app. You can also turn on Timeline if you want to create a private map of where you go with your signed-in devices. And if your Web & App Activity setting is enabled, your searches and other activity from Google services, which may also include location information, is saved to your Google Account. Learn more about how we use location information.\n\nIn some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google\u2019s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, such as directory services who provide us with business information to be displayed on Google\u2019s services, marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from partners to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.\n\nWe use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.\n\n\nWhy Google collects data\nWe use data to build better services\nWe use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:\n\nProvide our services\n\nWe use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\n\nMaintain & improve our services\n\nWe also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services \u2014 for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.\n\nDevelop new services\n\nWe use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google\u2019s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.\n\nProvide personalized services, including content and ads\n\nWe use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve already installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.\n\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services. For example, if you search for \u201cmountain bikes,\u201d you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.\n\nWe don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.\nWe don\u2019t show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.\nWe don\u2019t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the \u201ctap to call\u201d button, we\u2019ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.\n\nGo to My Ad Center\n\nMeasure performance\n\nWe use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.\n\nCommunicate with you\n\nWe use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we\u2019ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.\n\nProtect Google, our users, and the public\n\nWe use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.\n\nWe use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.\n\nWe may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google\u2019s services and the ads delivered by Google.\n\nIf other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.\n\nWe\u2019ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn\u2019t covered in this Privacy Policy.\n\n\nYour privacy controls\nYou have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used\nThis section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products \u2014 you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.\n\n\nGo to Privacy Checkup\n\nManaging, reviewing, and updating your information\nWhen you\u2019re signed in, you can always review and update information by visiting the services you use.

And if you have Web & App Activity turned on, your searches and activity from other Google services are saved in your account so you can get more personalized experiences like faster searches and more helpful app and content recommendations. Web & App Activity also has a subsetting that lets you control whether information about your activity on other sites, apps, and devices that use Google services, such as apps you install and use on Android, is saved in your Google Account and used to improve Google services.\n\nGo to Activity Controls\n\n\nAd settings\nManage your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and on sites and apps that partner with Google to show ads.

You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.\nDevice-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.\n\nSharing your information\nWhen you share your information\nMany of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.\n\nWhen you\u2019re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity.

We also use service providers to help review YouTube video content for public safety and analyze and listen to samples of saved user audio to help improve Google\u2019s audio recognition technologies.\n\nFor legal reasons\nWe will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:\n\nRespond to any applicable law, regulation,legal process, or enforceable governmental request.

Google may update the URL Terms from time to time by posting any such update at the relevant URL Term. Unless otherwise noted by Google, material updates to the URL Terms will become effective 30 days after they have been posted.

The arbitration will be conducted in Spanish by one arbitrator, mutually selected by the parties, in Mexico City, Mexico, which will be the seat of arbitration.\n\n(iv) Confidentiality. The arbitration is Confidential Information (including the arbitration's existence and any oral or written information related to it). However, the parties may disclose to a competent court any information necessary (a) to require the aid of the competent courts before or during the arbitral proceeding; or (b) to execute any arbitral decision, but only if the confidentiality of those materials is maintained in those judicial proceedings.\n\n(v) Non-monetary relief. The arbitrator may only issue an award based on law, not in equity, and may not award non-monetary relief.\n\n(vi) Fees and expenses. Each party will bear its own lawyers' and experts' fees and expenses and the arbitrator's final decision must not include any rulings in this regard.\n\nA new Section 15.18.1 (Currency) has been included as follows. As a consequence, Section 15.18 has been revised as follows:\n\n15.18 Conflicting languages. If this Agreement is translated into any language other than English and there is a discrepancy between the English text and the translated text, the English text will govern unless expressly stated otherwise in the translation. \n\n15.18.1 Currency. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, any ancillary document or corresponding invoice, all references to '$' in this Agreement refer to Mexican pesos. If a currency conversion is required in relation to the calculation of the Fees, that conversion will be carried out using the daily average exchange rate set by a reputable third party chosen by Google in accordance with applicable law. \n\nThe 'Taxes' definition in Section 15.19 (Definitions) has been replaced as follows: \n\n'Tax(es)' means all government-imposed tax obligations (including taxes, duties and withholdings), except those based on net income, net worth, asset value, property value or employment."

Certain of our Services are free; however, if you subscribe to any of our paid Services, you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes in U.S. Dollars.

All subscriptions are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the subscription becomes payable.

You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use the payment method you provide to us or our payment processor, including, without limitation, any credit card you provide when completing a transaction. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice and in our sole and complete discretion, to (a) discontinue, modify, or limit the available quantity of, any Offerings, and (b) refuse to allow any user to purchase any Offering or deliver such Offerings to a user or a user designated address. When you purchase Offerings, you (i) agree to pay the price for such Offerings as set forth in the applicable Service, and all shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes in connection with your purchase (the \u201cFull Purchase Amount\u201d), and (ii) authorize us to charge your credit card or other payment method for the Full Purchase Amount. Unless otherwise noted, all currency references are in U.S. Dollars. All fees and charges are payable in accordance with payment terms in effect at the time the fee or the charge becomes payable. Payment can be made by credit card, debit card, or through PayPal or other means that we may make available.

We may offer certain promotional codes, referral codes, discount codes, coupon codes or similar offers (\u201cPromotional Codes\u201d) that may be redeemed for discounts on benefits related to the Services or future Offerings, subject to any additional terms that the Company establishes. You agree that Promotional Codes: (a) must be used in a lawful manner; (b) must be used for the intended audience and purpose; (c) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available by you to the general public (whether posted to a public forum, coupon collecting service, or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by the Company; (d) may be disabled or have additional conditions applied to them by the Company at any time for any reason without liability to the Company; (e) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that the Company establishes for such Promotional Code; (f) are not valid for cash or other credits or points; and (g) may expire prior to your use. \n\n\n3.3 Changes and Pricing. The Company may, at any time, revise or change the pricing, availability, specifications, content, descriptions or features of any Offerings. While we attempt to be as accurate as we can in our descriptions for the Offerings, we do not warrant that Offering descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. The inclusion of any Offerings for purchase through the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that the Offerings will be available at any other time. We reserve the right to change prices for Offerings displayed on the Services at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur (and to cancel any orders in our sole discretion that were purchased with pricing errors). All such changes shall be effective immediately upon posting of such new Offering prices to the Services and/or upon making the customer aware of the pricing error. \n\n\n3.4 Order Acceptance; Shipment. Once we receive your order for an Offering, we will provide you with an order confirmation. Your receipt of an order confirmation, however, does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell; we are simply confirming that we received your order. We reserve the right at any time after receiving your order to accept or decline your order for any reason and in our sole discretion. If we cancel an order after you have already been billed, then we will refund the billed amount. Title and risk of loss for any purchases of physical products pass to you upon our delivery to our carrier. We reserve the right to ship partial orders (at no additional cost to you), and the portion of any order that is partially shipped may be charged at the time of shipment. All orders are shipped using one of our third-party couriers. Online tracking may be available at our courier\u2019s website (for example, FedEx), though we make no warranties regarding its availability because it is not under our control. While deliveries may be scheduled for a specified arrival, we cannot guarantee delivery by any specific date or time.\n\n\n3.5 Manufacturer\u2019s Warranty and Disclaimers. Certain of the Offerings made available on the Services are manufactured by third parties (\u201cThird-Party Offerings\u201d).  The availability of Third-Party Offerings through the Services does not indicate an affiliation with or endorsement by us of any Third-Party Offering or its manufacturer. Accordingly, we do not provide any warranties with respect to the Third-Party Offerings.  \n\n\n3.6 No Delivery to Children. Users are not allowed to give the Company the personal information of any persons under the age of 13 for delivery or shipping purposes or any other reason.\n\n\n\n\nLOCATION OF OUR PRIVACY POLICY  \n\n\n4.1 Privacy Policy.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, YOU AGREE THAT IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY ENTITIES BE LIABLE (A) FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING INDIRECT SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES), HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER UNDER THESE TERMS OR OTHERWISE ARISING IN ANY WAY IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES (INCLUDING ANY OUTPUT) OR THESE TERMS AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) EVEN IF THE COMPANY ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, OR (B) FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM, DEMAND OR DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, OUTPUT, OR THE DELIVERY, USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES OR OUTPUT.

By entering into these Terms and accessing or using the Services, you agree that you shall defend, indemnify and hold the Company Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees and costs) incurred by the Company Entities arising out of or in connection with: (a) your violation or breach of any term of these Terms or any applicable law or regulation; (b) your violation of any rights of any third party; (c) your misuse of the Services; (d) Your Content; or (e) your negligence or wilful misconduct. If you are obligated to indemnify any Company Entity hereunder, then you agree that Company (or, at its discretion, the applicable Company Entity) will have the right, in its sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding and to determine whether Company wishes to settle, and if so, on what terms, and you agree to fully cooperate with Company in the defense or settlement of such claim.\n\n\n\n\nARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\n\n\n9.1 PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY \u2013 IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.\n\n\n\n9.2 Informal Process First.  You and the Company agree that in the event of any dispute, either party will first contact the other party and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation, any court action, after first allowing the receiving party 30 days in which to respond.  Both you and the Company agree that this dispute resolution procedure is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before initiating any arbitration against the other party.\n\n\n\n9.3 Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.  After the informal dispute resolution process, any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to the Company\u2019s services and/or products, including the Services, and any use or access or lack of access thereto, will be resolved by arbitration, including threshold questions of arbitrability of the Claim. You and the Company agree that any Claim will be settled by final and binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the \u201cJAMS Rules\u201d) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms).  Because your contract with the Company, these Terms, and this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) governs the arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration will be handled by a sole arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis \u2013 class arbitrations and Class Actions (as defined below) are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Company are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a Class Action or class arbitration.\n\n\n\n9.4 Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Company agree that the following types of disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction: \n\n\n\nClaims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as it is brought and maintained as an individual dispute and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding;\n\nClaims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or \n\nintellectual property Claims.\n\n\n\n9.5 Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Company will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below). Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim or the relief sought in the demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse the Company for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the applicable rules. If you prevail in the arbitration and are awarded an amount that is less than the last written settlement amount offered by the Company before the arbitrator was appointed, the Company will pay you the amount it offered in settlement.  The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator\u2019s ruling on the merits.\n\n\n9.6 Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to support@perplexity.ai or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the \u201cHow to Contact Us\u201d section of these Terms. The notice must be sent to the Company within 30 days of your first registering to use the Services or agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the Class Action waiver, the Class Action waiver still applies.  You may not opt out of only the Class Action waiver and not also the arbitration provisions.  If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, the Company also will not be bound by them.\n\n\n9.7 WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND THE COMPANY EACH AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM, OR CONTROVERSY WILL BE BROUGHT AND CONDUCTED ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (\u201cCLASS ACTION\u201d).  YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION.  YOU AND THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM.  IF THE DISPUTE IS SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION.  FURTHER, YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON\u2019S CLAIMS, AND IT MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, HOWEVER, YOU CAN SEEK PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO THE EXTENT AUTHORIZED BY LAW AND CONSISTENT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS CLAUSE ABOVE. IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES\u2019 AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION.  IF A COURT DECIDES THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS PARAGRAPH ARE DEEMED INVALID OR UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PUTATIVE CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION MUST BE BROUGHT IN A COURT OF PROPER JURISDICTION AND NOT IN ARBITRATION.\n\n\n\n\nSHOPPING WITH PERPLEXITY PRO\n\n\nShop With Pro.

We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to send us sensitive or confidential information. \n\n\n\nWe retain your information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. When determining the length of time to retain your information, we consider various criteria, including whether we need the information to continue to provide you the Services, resolve a dispute, enforce our contractual agreements, prevent harm, promote safety, security and integrity, or protect ourselves, including our rights, property or products.\n\n\nU.S. RESIDENTS\n\n\nThis section supplements the other sections of this Privacy Policy and applies to you only if you are a resident of California or another U.S. state that has passed a privacy law similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) that applies to us, and the law requires specific privacy notice disclosures. For purposes of this section, references to \u201cpersonal information\u201d shall include \u201csensitive personal information,\u201d as these terms are defined under the CCPA.\n\n\n\nProcessing of Personal Information:\n\n\n\nIn the preceding 12 months, we collected and disclosed for a business purpose the following categories of personal information and sensitive personal information (denoted by *) about residents:\n\nIdentifiers, such as name, e-mail address and IP address\n\nPersonal information categories listed in the California Customer Records statute such as name, address and telephone number\n\nCommercial information such as records of products or services purchased\n\nInternet or other similar network activity such as Usage Data\n\nGeolocation data such as IP address\n\nProfessional or employment-related information such as title of profession, employer, professional background and other information provided by you when you apply for a job with us\n\nNon-public education information collected by certain federally funded institutions such as education records that you provide when you apply for a job with us\n\nAccount access credentials* for the Services\n\nThe contents of email messages in the email inboxes that you connect to your Perplexity account, and the content of email messages you send through Perplexity*\n\n\n\nThe specific business or commercial purposes for which we have collected and disclosed your personal information and the categories of sources from which we collect your personal information are described in the section above, Collection and Use Your Information.

Such request must state that they personally posted such content or information and detail where the content or information is posted. We will make reasonable good faith efforts to remove the post from prospective public view or anonymize it so the resident cannot be individually identified. This removal process cannot ensure complete or comprehensive removal. For instance, third parties may have republished the post, and archived copies of it may be stored by search engines and other parties that we do not control.\n\n\n\n10.  DATA TRANSFERS\n\n\nThe personal information that we collect will be transferred to, stored at/processed in, or accessed from countries outside the jurisdiction in which you are based in, for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including countries in which our service providers or other third parties described in Section 4 are located. Specifically, we have servers for the Service in the US.

By using the Services and acknowledging the Privacy Policy, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to third parties (if any), which may include the cross-border transfer of your information to any country or region where we have databases or affiliates and, in particular, to the jurisdictions specified herein. For such transfers of data outside the relevant jurisdiction will use applicable safeguards, for example,  for UK and EEA users, the European Commission\u2019s model contracts for the transfer of personal information to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the \u201cModel Clauses\u201d), or any equivalent contracts issued by the relevant competent authority of the UK, as relevant, unless the data transfer is to a country that has been determined by the European Commission or the relevant UK authorities, as applicable, to provide an adequate level of protection for individuals\u2019 rights and freedoms for their personal information. Please contact us at support@perplexity.ai should you wish to inquire further as to such data transfer mechanisms, including to examine a copy of the Model Clauses.\n\n\n\nFor EU and UK users:\n\n\n\nWe comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (collectively, the \u201cDPF\u201d) and have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the DPF Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and UK (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the DPF.\n\n\n\nIf there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern to the extent applicable to the information at issue. The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over our compliance with the DPF and, in accordance with the DPF, we are responsible for onward transfers to third parties that process personal information subject to the DPF in a way that does not follow the DPF Principles. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, and to view our certification, please visit the Data Privacy Framework website.\n\n\n\nWe commit to resolve DPF Principles-related complaints about our collection and use of personal information. Individuals in the EU and UK with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the DPF should first contact us, at support@perplexity.ai. If you have an unresolved complaint concerning our handling of personal information received in reliance on the DPF that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third-party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/.

Any changes to subscription fees will become effective at the end of the current subscription period.  We will provide you with reasonable advance notice prior to any change in subscription fees taking effect, allowing you the opportunity to terminate your subscription before such changes become effective.  Continuing to use the service after the subscription fee change is effective constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.\n\n4.3 Credits\n\nThe Services operate on a credit-based system.  Credits may be purchased, earned, or granted through promotions or subscriptions.  Each service consumes a predefined number of credits (\u201cCredits\u201d) based on complexity, volume, or duration, which is determined at Company\u2019s sole discretion.  The platform provider retains full discretion to determine the value of a Credit, including but not limited to, the amount or type of processing, service access, or computational resources each credit enables.  Credit consumption rates may vary depending on the type of service accessed, the complexity of the request, the size or length of the input or output, model tier, or any other relevant technical factor.  The platform makes no guarantees that a specific number of Credits will yield a fixed quantity or quality of output.  The Company reserves the right to modify, increase, or decrease the number of credits required to access specific features, tools, or model capabilities, with or without prior notice.  These changes may reflect shifts in system demand, operational costs, new feature releases, or technical upgrades.  The platform may classify services into credit tiers (e.g., free, event, daily, monthly, etc.).  While the Company may provide users with up-to-date credit usage information, including estimations of consumption, it is not liable for discrepancies between projected and actual usage.\n\nAll Credits shall expire in accordance with the Company\u2019s Credit Rule as may be updated from time to time.  All Credit purchases are final and non-refundable, except where required by law. Upon termination of your account for any reason, unused Credits may be forfeited without compensation.  If the Company finds that credits were obtained or used fraudulently, it reserves the right to invalidate those Credits and take appropriate legal action.\n\nCredits may only be used by the account to which they were issued and may not be transferred, resold, or exchanged for cash or other value.  The platform reserves the right to adjust credit costs, modify available services, or change the Credit system at any time with or without notice.\n\n4.4 Refund Policy\n\nExcept where required by applicable law, all payments made for subscriptions, Credits, or other paid features are final and non-refundable.  You acknowledge that once access to a paid service or Credit has been granted, the Company has fully performed its obligations and no refund will be issued.\n\nThe Company may, at its sole discretion, consider a partial refund request in exceptional circumstances.  If approved, any refund will be calculated based on the proportion of unused Credits, excluding any discounts, promotions, or taxes paid.  The final determination of eligibility and refund amount rests entirely with the Company.\n\nIf you are a consumer residing in the European Union, the United Kingdom, or Turkey, you have the right to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws.  \n\nRefunds (if approved) will be processed to your original payment method within 1\u201315 business days, depending on your payment institution\u2019s processing time.\n\nWe reserve the rights to refuse the refunds if:\n\nYour account has been restricted, suspended, or terminated due to policy violations, abuse, or fraud;\nYou have already received a prior refund for similar products or services;\nYou purchased credits, subscriptions, or other services via promotions, coupons, or discounted pricing; or\nThe refund request is made after the applicable period or relates to used Credits or consumed services.\nThe Company reserves the right to refuse or limit refund requests at its discretion to prevent abuse or excessive refund activity.\n\nFor any refund inquiries, contact us at support@manus.im (or feedback@manus.im for US users).\n\n\n\n5.

Your use of the Services may also be subject to U.S. and other local, state, national, or international laws.\n\n12.2 Dispute Resolution\n\n12.2.1 Informal Dispute Resolution\n\nIf you have any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Services, including claims and disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms (a \u201dDispute\u201d), you agree to first attempt to resolve the Dispute informally.  You and the Company agree to participate in good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an action in small claims court (\"Informal Dispute Resolution\").  To initiate Informal Dispute Resolution, a party must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\").  Such Notice to the Company should be sent by email to by contacting the Company via email, i.e., support@manus.im (or feedback@manus.im for US users).  The Company will send any Notice to you via email we have on file associated with your account.  To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the user name, email address and phone number associated with your account.  The Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in Informal Dispute Resolution.\n\n12.2.2 Dispute Resolution for Non-U.S., Non-UK and European Union (EU) Users\n\nFor any Dispute that is not resolved informally within the 45-day period, and where these Terms do not specify a mandatory dispute resolution process or the local law does not require otherwise, you and the Company agree that any Dispute will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (\u201cSIAC\u201d) under the Arbitration Rules of the SIAC in force at the time of delivery of the arbitration notice, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.\n\nThe arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the laws of Singapore, with the seat of arbitration in Singapore, and the language of the proceedings in English.  The Tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator, to be appointed by mutual agreement of the parties.  If the parties are unable to agree on the appointment within thirty (30) days from the date of the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration, the sole arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the SIAC in accordance with the SIAC Rules.  The arbitrator shall award only such damages as are permitted under these Terms.  Each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees), and the parties shall equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrator unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator in the final award.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, either party may always apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction or any other legal or equitable relief.\n\n12.2.3 Dispute Resolution For UK and EU Users\n\nIf you are a consumer in the UK or European Union, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence and nothing in these Terms shall affect your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence.\n\nIn the event of any Dispute, you and Company agree that such individual claim or dispute shall be resolved in the competent court in the country in which you are ordinarily resident, provided such country is in the European Union or United Kingdom.\n\n12.2.4 Dispute Resolution For U.S. Users\n\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT, WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND REQUIRES YOU TO PROCEED TO ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.\n\nYou and the Company agree that any Dispute will be resolved by final and binding arbitration.  This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and will be interpreted and enforced accordingly.\n\nA. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\nBefore either party may seek arbitration, the parties agree to attempt to resolve any Dispute informally pursuant to Section 12.2.1.  The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for forty-five (45) days from the date that either you or the Company first sends the applicable notice, allowing the parties to engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\n\nB. BINDING ARBITRATION\n\nAny Dispute not resolved through the informal dispute resolution process within 60 days shall be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration.\n\nThe arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201dNAM\u201d) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available here).  The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in a court of law.  \n\nC. EXCEPTIONS\n\nThis section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.\n\nD. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL\n\nYOU AND THE COMPANY KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and the Company are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under these Terms, except as specified herein.\n\nE. WAIVER OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS\n\nYOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.\n\nF. BATCH ARBITRATION\n\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and the Company agree that if twenty-five (25) or more claimants, represented by the same or similar counsel or organizations, file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within a ninety (90) day period, then NAM shall administer them in batches.\n\nBatch Administration: NAM will administer these demands in batches of up to fifty (50) claimants each (\u201cBatch\u201d).\nConsolidation: NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees due per side per Batch, and one final award for that Batch.\nSubstantially Similar Disputes: Requests are deemed of a \u201csubstantially similar nature\u201d if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.\nThis Batch Arbitration provision shall be interpreted in accordance with NAM\u2019s Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, but shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.\n\nG. OPT-OUT MECHANISM\n\nYou have the right to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement set forth in this section within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted these Terms.\n\nTo effectively opt out, you must provide us with notice of your decision by certified mail to the physical address listed below: \n\nButterfly Effect Pte.

The information or content that you upload to or include with your GPT (for example your GPT name, instructions, and description) (\u201cGPT Content\u201d) is your Content. As between you and OpenAI, you are solely responsible for your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations that you use or enable to create your GPT as well as any Output that is based on your GPT Content, Actions, and configurations. You must ensure your GPT complies with the Agreement and our Usage Policies\u2060\u2060.\n(b) Distribution and Promotion of GPTs.

You are free to stop using our Services at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to our Services or delete your account if we determine:\n\nYou breached these Terms or our Usage Policies\u2060\u2060.\nWe must do so to comply with the law.\nYour use of our Services could cause risk or harm to OpenAI, our users, or anyone else.\nWe also may terminate your account if it has been inactive for over a year and you do not have a paid account. If we do, we will provide you with advance notice.\n\nAppeals. If you believe we have suspended or terminated your account in error, you can file an appeal with us by contacting our Support team\u2060\u2060(opens in a new window).\n\nDiscontinuation of Services\nWe may decide to discontinue our Services, but if we do, we will give you advance notice and a refund for any prepaid, unused Services.\n\nDisclaimer of warranties\nOUR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS.\u201d EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ACCURATE OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT LOST OR ALTERED. \n\nYOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT ANY USE OF OUTPUTS FROM OUR SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND YOU WILL NOT RELY ON OUTPUT AS A SOLE SOURCE OF TRUTH OR FACTUAL INFORMATION, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.\n\nLimitation of liability\nNEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER LOSSES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED \u200b\u200bTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n\nSome countries and states do not allow the disclaimer of certain warranties or the limitation of certain damages, so some or all of the terms above may not apply to you, and you may have additional rights. In that case, these Terms only limit our responsibilities to the maximum extent permissible in your country of residence.\n\nOPENAI\u2019S AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF THIS SECTION.\n\nIndemnity\nIf you are a business or organization, to the extent permitted by law, you will indemnify and hold harmless us, our affiliates, and our personnel, from and against any costs, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) from third party claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Services and Content or any violation of these Terms.\n\nDispute resolution\nYOU AND OPENAI AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER PROVISIONS:\n\nMANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and OpenAI agree to resolve any claims arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services, regardless of when the claim arose, even if it was before these Terms existed (a \u201cDispute\u201d), through final and binding arbitration. You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of account creation or of any updates to these arbitration terms within 30 days after the update has taken effect by filling out this form\u2060. If you opt out of an update, the last set of agreed upon arbitration terms will apply. \n\nInformal dispute resolution. We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before either of us files a claim against the other, we both agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally. You agree to do so by sending us notice through this form\u2060. We will do so by sending you notice to the email address associated with your account. If we are unable to resolve a Dispute within 60 days, either of us has the right to initiate arbitration. We also both agree to attend an individual settlement conference if either party requests one during this time. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during this informal resolution process.\n\nArbitration forum. If we are unable to resolve the Dispute, either of us may commence arbitration with National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available here\u2060\u2060(opens in a new window)).\n\nOpenAI will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. The activities described in these Terms involve interstate commerce and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration terms and any arbitration. \n\nArbitration procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by videoconference if possible, but if the arbitrator determines a hearing should be conducted in person, the location will be mutually agreed upon, in the county where you reside, or as determined by the arbitrator, unless the batch arbitration process applies. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, except the state or federal courts of San Francisco, California have the authority to determine any Dispute about enforceability, validity of the class action waiver, or requests for public injunctive relief, as set out below. Any settlement offer amounts will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, if any. The arbitrator has the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. \n\nExceptions. This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.\n\nCLASS AND JURY TRIAL WAIVERS. You and OpenAI agree that Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, and representative actions are prohibited. Only individual relief is available. The parties agree to sever and litigate in court any request for public injunctive relief after completing arbitration for the underlying claim and all other claims. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement. You and OpenAI knowingly and irrevocably waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. \n\nBatch arbitration. If 25 or more claimants represented by the same or similar counsel file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within 90 days of each other, then you and OpenAI agree that NAM will administer them in batches of up to 50 claimants each (\u201cBatch\u201d), unless there are less than 50 claimants in total or after batching, which will comprise a single Batch. NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees, and one hearing held by videoconference or in a location decided by the arbitrator for each Batch. If any part of this section is found to be invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claimant or Batch, it will be severed and arbitrated in individual proceedings.  \n\nSeverability. If any part of these arbitration terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class arbitration, class action, or representative action, this entire dispute resolution section will be unenforceable in its entirety.\n\nCopyright complaints\nIf you believe that your intellectual property rights have been infringed, please send notice to the address below or fill out this form\u2060. We may delete or disable content that we believe violates these Terms or is alleged to be infringing and will terminate accounts of repeat infringers where appropriate.\n\nOpenAI OpCo, LLC\n1455 3rd Street\nSan Francisco, CA 94158\nAttn: General Counsel / Copyright Agent\n\nWritten claims concerning copyright infringement must include the following information:\n\nA physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest\nA description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon\nA description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on our site so we can find it\nYour address, telephone number, and e-mail address\nA statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law\nA statement by you that the above information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner\u2019s behalf\nGeneral Terms\nAssignment. You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under these Terms and any attempt to do so will be void. We may assign our rights or obligations under these Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or successor in interest of any business associated with our Services.\n\nChanges to these Terms or our Services. We are continuously working to develop and improve our Services. We may update these Terms or our Services accordingly from time to time. For example, we may make changes to these Terms or the Services due to:\n\nChanges to the law or regulatory requirements.\nSecurity or safety reasons.\nCircumstances beyond our reasonable control.\nChanges we make in the usual course of developing our Services.\nTo adapt to new technologies.\nWe will give you at least 30 days advance notice of changes to these Terms that materially adversely impact you either via email or an in-product notification. All other changes will be effective as soon as we post them to our website. If you do not agree to the changes, you must stop using our Services.\n\nDelay in enforcing these Terms. Our failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later. Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above, if any portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.\n\nTrade controls. You must comply with all applicable trade laws, including sanctions and export control laws. Our Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, or exported or re-exported to (a) any U.S. embargoed country or territory or (b) any individual or entity with whom dealings are prohibited or restricted under applicable trade laws. Our Services may not be used for any end use prohibited by applicable trade laws, and your Input may not include material or information that requires a government license for release or export. \n\nEntire agreement. These Terms contain the entire agreement between you and OpenAI regarding the Services and, other than any Service-specific terms, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and OpenAI. \n\nGoverning law. California law will govern these Terms except for its conflicts of laws principles. Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco, California."

Paid plans are billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and renew automatically unless you cancel before the renewal date in your account settings. Plan limits (for example, seats, features, or usage thresholds) are described on the Site and may change from time to time. Except where required by law, subscription fees are non-refundable.\n\nCredits and Separate Balances (Optional Services)\n\nLovable Cloud and the AI Gateway run on Cloud Credits. You have two separate balances - one for Lovable Cloud and one for the AI Gateway. Cloud Credits are consumed as you use those Services and are in addition to any Platform subscription fees.\n\nFree vs. Paid Credits\n\nFree Credits: We may grant Free Credits (for example, $25/month for Lovable Cloud and $1/month for the AI Gateway).\nPaid Credits: You can buy Paid Credits anytime. Credits don't earn interest and have no cash or stored-value equivalent.\nPaid Cloud Credits: You can buy Paid Cloud Credits anytime. Paid Cloud Credits don't earn interest and have no cash or stored-value equivalent.\nCredit Rollover and Expiration\n\nFree Credits: Daily Free Credits are granted to users daily or on a specific schedule according to their plan and agreement automatically.

When this cap is reached, any additional unused credits beyond the cap will not roll over.\nRollover credits are used before your current billing period's credits when you use the Services.\nRollover credits remain available as long as you maintain an active paid subscription plan. Upon plan change, cancellation, or downgrade, rollover credits are subject to forfeiture as described in the \"Refunds and Termination\" section.\nBuying Credits and Auto-Reload\n\nYou may purchase Credits through Stripe or another third-party payment processor that we designate from time to time. By purchasing Credits, you agree to be bound by the applicable terms and conditions of the payment processor in addition to these Terms. You may also enable auto-reload so that your balance is automatically replenished when it falls below a threshold you select. We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of our designated payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.\n\nInvoices and Records\n\nWe issue monthly invoices that show: (a) your Platform subscription charges (if any), and (b) your usage by Service (Lovable Cloud vs. AI Gateway). Invoices are generated based on the records of our designated third-party payment processor (such as Stripe). We rely solely on the records, calculations, and determinations of that payment processor with respect to payments, metering, invoicing, and account balances, and you agree that those determinations are final and binding absent manifest error.\n\nNo Refunds; Not a Financial Instrument\n\nCredits are prepaid, non-refundable, and non-redeemable for cash or any other value. Credits represent only a limited license to access the Services and are not deposits, stored value, or financial instruments. For rollover and expiration rules, see the \"Credit Rollover and Expiration\" section above. For forfeiture rules, see the \"Refunds and Termination\" section.\n\nMetering and Third-Party Dependencies\n\nWe use reasonable efforts to meter usage accurately, but metering depends on third-party services (including Stripe, Supabase, and Third-Party AI Providers). By using the Services, you agree that our metering and billing records are authoritative.\n\nTaxes and Withholding\nFees and Credits are exclusive of taxes. You\u2019re responsible for any taxes, duties, or government charges that apply, other than taxes based on our income.\n\nService Dependencies and Availability\nWe provide the Services, including the Platform, Lovable Cloud, and the AI Gateway, using a combination of our own technology and third-party providers. These include Infrastructure Providers for Lovable Cloud and Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter) for the AI Gateway. Because we do not fully control these providers, we cannot guarantee the uninterrupted availability, performance, or security of the Services. You understand and agree that interruptions, delays, or errors may occur, and that we will not be responsible for issues caused by those providers or by events beyond our reasonable control (including force majeure events).\n\nAI Use Disclaimer\nThe Services may use artificial intelligence models to generate code, content, or other outputs (\"AI Output\"). AI Output may contain errors, inaccuracies, or other issues and should not be relied upon without independent review and testing. You are solely responsible for reviewing, validating, and using any AI Output, whether it is generated through:\n\nour Platform\u2019s integrated AI;\nthe AI Gateway (via Third-Party AI Providers such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter); or\nany model or API that you connect to the Services.\nYou assume full responsibility for your use of AI Output and agree not to rely on it for critical or high-risk functions (including medical, legal, financial, or safety-related purposes) without appropriate safeguards. AI Output may be similar or identical to content generated for other users who submit similar prompts. We do not guarantee that AI Output will be unique, free of third-party rights, accurate, or suitable for any particular purpose.\n\nCustomer Data and Privacy\nNo Sensitive Data\nYou agree not to upload, input, or otherwise provide any protected health information under HIPAA, or any other sensitive categories of data (such as financial account numbers, government identifiers, or biometric data). Our Services are not designed to handle that type of data, and we disclaim all responsibility if you choose to submit it.\n\nUse of Infrastructure and AI Providers\nThe Services, including the Platform, Lovable Cloud, and the AI Gateway, run in part on Infrastructure Providers (for example, Supabase and other hosting or database providers). In addition, the Platform and the AI Gateway both transmit your inputs, prompts, and related data to artificial intelligence systems, including large language models and other machine learning models, in order to generate code, content, or other outputs. These systems may be provided by us, by Third-Party AI Providers (such as OpenAI, Google, or OpenRouter), or by models that you connect yourself. By using the Services, you consent to these transfers, processing, and storage.\n\nRights in Customer Data\nExcept for PII, you grant us a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, process, analyze, and otherwise exploit your Customer Data for our business purposes, including without limitation:\n\noperating, maintaining, and improving the Services;\ndeveloping and training artificial intelligence and machine learning models;\ncreating benchmarks, analytics, and insights; and\nany other lawful business purpose.\nIf you do not want your Customer Data used for model training or other business purposes, you may opt out by contacting us or by upgrading to a Business plan that provides enhanced data-handling controls.\n\nUse of PII\nWe will not use raw or identifiable PII for model training. We do not sell PII and we do not share it with third parties for advertising or marketing.

By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree to those providers\u2019 rights.\n\nCustomer Responsibility\nYou are responsible for ensuring that your use of the Services, including transfers of Customer Data through the Platform, Lovable Cloud, the AI Gateway, or any model or service you connect, complies with applicable data protection and privacy laws.\n\nRefunds and Termination\nForfeiture on Termination\nIf your account/Services are terminated by us for a breach of the Terms by you, any remaining Credits (Free or Paid) will be forfeited. If you cancel your account/Services, the remaining Credits will remain available until the end of billing period. If we terminate your account/Services for any reason other than your breach of the Terms (including for security, legal, or other reasons not attributable to you), any remaining Credits will be applied to fees owed through the effective date of termination, after which they will expire.\n\nNo Refunds\n\nExcept where required by law, all fees are non-refundable.\n\nEffect of Termination\n\nTermination of your account or these Terms ends your right to access the Services, but does not affect any rights or obligations that, by their nature, should continue (for example, intellectual property rights, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and payment obligations).\n\nMarketing and Promotions\nPromotional Credits and Offers\nFrom time to time, we may provide you with promotional credits or other promotional offers, such as free access to the AI Gateway for a limited period.

Self-referrals will be automatically blocked and may result in account termination.\n\nNo Brand Bidding\n\nAffiliates may not bid on \"Lovable\" or any misspellings or variations of the brand in paid search ads (e.g., Google Ads). Violations will result in forfeiture of all commissions in the month where a violation occurred, permanent exclusion from affiliate commissions for any users acquired through brand bidding (as these users would have found Lovable organically), and possible account deactivation.\n\nNo Search Engine Traffic\n\nAffiliates are also generally not permitted to generate commissions by driving traffic to their link via search engine ads.\n\nNo Spam or Misleading Promotions\n\nAffiliates may not use spammy tactics, misleading claims, or false endorsements in promoting Lovable. This includes fake discounts, deceptive landing pages, or unauthorized use of brand assets.\n\nPayouts Are Conditional\n\nRewards are only granted for valid, completed signups that meet the criteria set in the campaign.\nFraudulent or incomplete referrals will not be paid out.\n\nTermination Rights\n\nLovable reserves the right to revoke affiliate access and withhold commissions for any violation\nof these Terms or behavior that appears fraudulent, abusive, or misaligned with Lovable's values.\n\nOwnership\nOur Rights\nWe (and our licensors) own all rights, title, and interest in and to the Services and Lovable Materials. This includes the Platform, Lovable Cloud, the AI Gateway, the Site, all underlying software, infrastructure, technology, databases, APIs, models, algorithms, interfaces, and tools, and all improvements, modifications, or derivative works of the foregoing. Except for the limited license we grant you under these Terms, we reserve all rights in and to the Services and Lovable Materials.\n\nYour Rights\nAs between us, you own your Customer Data, including the applications, websites, or other projects you build using the Services. As between us, you also own any AI Output generated for you through the Services, subject to any third-party rights in the underlying models, training data, or outputs.\n\nUsage Data\nWe own all Usage Data generated by or in connection with your use of the Services. We may use Usage Data for any business purpose, including monitoring, analytics, benchmarking, improving the Services, and developing new features or offerings.\n\nFeedback\nIf you provide us with any feedback, suggestions, ideas, or other information relating to the Services or our business (\"Feedback\"), you agree that we may use, copy, modify, distribute, publish, or otherwise exploit that Feedback for any purpose, in any form, and through any medium, without restriction or compensation to you.

        "LovablePrivacyPolicy.txt": "Privacy Policy\nLast Updated: September 29, 2025\n\nLovable Labs Incorporated (\"Lovable,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is an AI-powered platform dedicated to empowering developers and non-technical users to build, share, and deploy web applications using natural language prompts. Our mission is to simplify software development through innovative tools, seamless integrations, and collaborative features, while prioritizing the privacy and security of your data. We are committed to fostering a vibrant developer community and ensuring compliance with applicable privacy laws in the United States (including all applicable state privacy statutes), European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Canada.\n\nThis Privacy Policy (\"Policy\"), available online at https://www.lovable.dev/privacy, outlines how Lovable collects, uses, shares, and otherwise processes personal information from users, including developers, entrepreneurs, and visitors (\"User,\" \"you,\" or \"your\") of our website, platform, and services (collectively, our \"Services\"). By using our Services, you acknowledge this Policy; our legal basis for processing may include contract performance, legitimate interests, or legal obligations, as set out in Section 3. This Policy incorporates our Terms of Service and any applicable Data Processing Agreement (DPA) by reference. You may view our Data Processing Agreement at www.lovable.dev/data-processing-agreement. If you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, please discontinue your use of our Services. Existing users with contractual obligations should contact us to discuss applicable terms. In the event of any conflict between this Policy and a signed DPA, the DPA will control with respect to Customer Personal Data\n\nPersonal Data: For purposes of this Policy, \"personal data\" (also called \"personal information\" under the California Consumer Privacy Act/Privacy Rights Act and similar U.S. state laws) means any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person or is reasonably capable of being linked to a particular consumer or household, as set out in the EU GDPR, UK GDPR, Canada's PIPEDA, the revised Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, and all applicable U.S. federal or state privacy statutes. Personal data may include, for example, your name, business email address, postal address, telephone number, username, unique device or browser identifiers, Internet-protocol (IP) address, authentication tokens, usage and telemetry logs, or other information generated through your use of our Services. Personal data also includes biometric, genetic, and special category data as defined under GDPR and international equivalents. Operational metrics and telemetry that Lovable processes independently for security, billing, analytics, or product-improvement purposes (\"Service Data\") are handled separately as described in Section 8 and are not treated as Customer Personal Data.\nLovable does not intentionally collect special-category or sensitive personal data, such as biometric identifiers, health information, or precise geolocation, and instructs customers not to upload such information. This definition will be interpreted to include any equivalent term under other privacy laws that come into force during the life of this Policy.\n\nCollection and Use of Information:\nInformation You Provide Directly: When you create an account, purchase a subscription, open a support ticket, or otherwise use our Services, you may supply personal data such as your name, business-email address, phone number, payment information (processed via Stripe; see Stripe's privacy policy at stripe.com/privacy for details on how they handle your card details and transaction data). For usage-based services like Lovable Cloud and AI Gateway, we collect and process Usage Data (e.g., API calls, storage usage, prompt volumes) to meter consumption against your Credits (prepaid balances). These Credits are tracked in separate balances per service, with metering reliant on Stripe and third-party providers. We do not store full payment card details; Stripe serves as the source of truth for billing records, which may include anonymized usage metrics shared with us for invoicing, and project artefacts (for example, natural-language prompts, code snippets, or deployment configurations). These artifacts are used only to serve your workspace and, once anonymized or aggregated, to improve our models; they are never used to train general-purpose AI models that benefit other customers without your permission.\nInformation Collected Automatically: When you interact with the Services, we automatically collect technical data such as IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, pages visited, timestamps, and error logs. Certain operational metrics and telemetry (\"Service Data\") are processed by Lovable as an independent controller for security, billing, analytics, and product-improvement purposes (see Section 10). Billing and Metering Data: Telemetry on service usage (e.g., compute hours in Lovable Cloud, API requests via AI Gateway) is collected to generate monthly invoices showing consumption by service. This data is anonymized where possible and shared with Stripe for payment processing and revenue recognition.\nUsage and Analytics Data: We record how you engage with key features (e.g., prompts submitted, code generated, build and deployment events, clicks on the GitHub or Supabase integrations). If you authorize a third-party integration, Lovable accesses only the minimum data required to provide that integration and processes it under the same terms as other Customer Personal Data.\nData Handling in Lovable Cloud and AI Gateway: Lovable Cloud provides cloud hosting and back-end services (e.g., database, authentication, storage), where your Customer Data (as defined in our Terms of Service), including hosted applications, files, and generated outputs, is stored and processed on Supabase infrastructure. By using Lovable Cloud, you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your Customer Data by Supabase under their privacy policy (available at supabase.com/privacy). The AI Gateway acts as a proxy to connect your applications to third-party AI providers, including OpenAI, Google Gemini, and models via OpenRouter. When using the AI Gateway, your inputs (e.g., prompts, queries) and related Customer Data are transmitted to these providers for processing and response generation. These transmissions occur on a pass-through basis; we do not store the raw prompts or responses unless you explicitly save them in your workspace. By using the AI Gateway, you consent to such transfers under the privacy policies of OpenRouter (openrouter.ai/privacy), OpenAI (openai.com/policies/privacy-policy), and Google (policies.google.com/privacy). We do not control these providers' data practices, and you are responsible for reviewing their policies.\nChildren's Data: Lovable's Services are not intended for individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data from anyone under this age. By using our Services, you represent that you are at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction. If we discover that we have collected personal data from a minor without verifiable parental consent, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe we may have collected such data, please contact us at privacy@lovable.dev.\nWe process this information on the legal basis of contract performance, legitimate interests, compliance with legal obligations, and your consent, for the following purposes:\n\nto provide, operate, and maintain the Services, including storing code, generating suggestions, and deploying applications;\nTo personalize your experience and tune AI-driven features for your workspace;\nto analyze usage patterns and improve performance, functionality, and reliability;\nto detect, prevent, and investigate fraud, abuse, or security incidents;\nto deliver product updates and measure the effectiveness of our own marketing;\nto communicate with you and provide customer support, as permitted by your account settings;\nto process payments and other transactions you authorize;\nto comply with legal, regulatory, export-control, and sanctions obligations in the jurisdictions where we operate; and\nto meet record-keeping, accounting, and audit requirements.\nLovable does not engage in automated decision-making that produces legal or similarly significant effects on individuals (GDPR Art 22). We collect only the personal data necessary for these purposes and retain it in line with the schedule in Section 11. You can exercise your opt-out or objection rights to certain processing activities as described in Section 9 (\"Your Privacy Choices\").\n\nLegal Bases for Processing Your Data: Lovable processes personal data only where a valid legal ground applies under each privacy regime that governs our Services.\nApplicable privacy frameworks\n\nUnited States: CCPA/CPRA (California), VCDPA (Virginia), CPA (Colorado), UCPA (Utah), CTDPA (Connecticut), and any other U.S. state privacy laws in force during your use of the Services.\nInternational: GDPR (EEA), UK GDPR, and the revised Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (rev-FADP) for residents of the EEA, United Kingdom, or Switzerland.\nCanada \u2013 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA).\nLegal bases we rely on\n\nPerformance of a Contract: We process your data to provide, maintain, and support the Services you have requested under our Terms of Service or other agreement with you.\nLegitimate Interests: We use personal data to secure the platform, detect fraud, generate aggregate analytics, and improve AI features where these interests are not outweighed by your privacy rights.\nConsent: We rely on your opt-in consent for non-essential cookies, marketing e-mails, and any other processing that requires consent under applicable law. You may withdraw consent at any time without affecting the lawfulness of prior processing.\nLegal Obligations: We retain and disclose information as necessary to comply with bookkeeping rules, export-control and sanctions regulations, court orders, or other legal duties.\nProtection of Vital Interests: In rare cases, we may process data to protect an individual's vital interests, such as preventing serious harm or responding to an emergency.\nPurposes of Use and Processing: We use personal information for the following business and commercial purposes:\nService Delivery and Support: Providing and maintaining our AI-driven platform, including code generation, debugging, and deployment.\nService Integrity: Ensuring the security and integrity of our Services, including preventing fraud or unauthorized access.\nService Improvement and Research: Analyzing prompts, usage data, and generated code to refine algorithms, enhance AI performance, and develop new features; where feasible, such analysis is performed on de-identified or aggregated data.\nPersonalization: Tailoring our Services to your preferences, such as optimizing code generation based on your prompts.\nProduct Updates and Limited Marketing: Sending product announcements, event invitations, and other communications you have opted to receive, and measuring their effectiveness. For promotional credits (e.g., free AI Gateway access), we may use your email and usage data to communicate offers. These are non-transferable and revocable; opt out of marketing via account settings.\nBusiness Continuity and Security: Safeguarding our business operations and proprietary data.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance: Complying with export-control and sanctions regulations, court orders, and privacy laws in the United States, European Economic Area, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Canada, and other applicable jurisdictions.\nAuditing, Accounting, and Corporate Governance: Conducting audits, reporting, and corporate governance to ensure compliance and efficiency.\nDispute Resolution and Legal Defense: Meeting legal and regulatory obligations in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions.\nData Processing and Sub-Processors: As a data processor, Lovable processes personal information on behalf of our customers in accordance with their instructions and applicable DPAs. We engage third-party sub-processors to support our Services, such as:\nHosting and maintaining our platform, website, and databases.\nProcessing payments through secure third-party payment processors.\nProviding technical support, customer service, and analytics.\nStoring and securing data, including integrations with Supabase and GitHub.\nAll sub-processors are bound by contractual obligations equivalent to those in our DPAs, ensuring compliance with applicable data protection laws. We provide notice of sub-processor changes, allowing customers to object within ten (10) business days. The current list of authorized sub-processors is always available at https://trust.lovable.dev and includes the sub-processor's name, location, and processing purpose (e.g., Stripe for billing, Supabase for cloud hosting, OpenAI/Google/OpenRouter for AI Gateway integrations).\n\nInternational Data Transfers: For customers in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we may transfer personal information to the United States or other jurisdictions whose privacy laws have not been deemed \"adequate\" by European or Swiss authorities. Lovable safeguards these transfers through the following legally recognized mechanisms:\nEU\u2013US Data Privacy Framework (DPF): When eligible, Lovable relies first on its DPF certification (and the UK and Swiss Extensions) for transfers from the EEA, UK, and Switzerland to the United States.\nEU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs): Module 2 (Controller-to-Processor) per Commission Decision 2021/914, incorporated into our DPAs.\nUK International Data Transfer Addendum: Version B1.0, issued by the UK ICO under s119A DPA 2018.\nSwiss Addendum: Adapts the SCCs to the revised Swiss FADP, naming the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) as the competent authority.\nInvestigations: Lovable may investigate and disclose information, as permitted by law, if we believe in good faith that such action is:\nNecessary to comply with a valid legal process or governmental request (e.g., subpoena, court order, or law-enforcement demand) and, unless legally prohibited, Lovable will notify the affected customer before producing data, consistent with our SCC and DPA obligations.\nHelpful to prevent, investigate, or identify fraud, security incidents, or other wrongdoing in connection with our Services.\nNecessary to protect our rights, reputation, property, or those of our users, affiliates, or the public.\nDisclosures will comply with applicable privacy laws and be limited to what is necessary.\n\nLog Data: When you use our Services, Lovable automatically collects operational telemetry (\"Log Data\") that helps us secure and improve the platform. Log Data may include:\nYour device's IP address and approximate location\nBrowser type and version.\nPages, APIs, or features you access within the Services.\nTimestamps and time spent on specific screens or functions.\nUnique session or device identifiers and error/debugging codes.\nOther usage statistics.\nLog data is retained for up to ninety (90) days, unless required by law, to monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and improve user experience.\n\nCookies and Other Tracking: Lovable and selected third-party partners use cookies, pixels, and similar technologies (\"Cookies\") to operate, secure, and analyze our Services. We deploy four types of Cookies:\nStrictly Necessary Cookies support core functions such as sign-in, session routing, fraud prevention, and consent storage. These are set on the basis of legitimate interests / contract performance and do not require consent.\nAnalytics & Performance Cookies measure feature adoption, diagnose errors, track user interactions, and improve service performance. We use first-party analytics (PostHog) and third-party services (Google Analytics, TikTok) for these purposes. We obtain prior consent for these Cookies in the EEA/UK/CH and honor CPRA \"opt-out\" signals (e.g., Global Privacy Control) in the United States.\nFunctional Cookies remember your preferences (language, theme, layout) and are configurable in the in-product \"Cookie Settings\" panel.\nMarketing Cookies enable conversion tracking and campaign measurement through third-party services including Tiktok, Facebook/Meta, and Google Ads. While we use these cookies to measure the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, we do not \"sell\" or \"share\" Customer Personal Data for cross-context behavioral advertising as defined under applicable privacy laws. These cookies require consent in the EEA/UK/CH and respect opt-out preferences in other jurisdictions.\nYou can manage or withdraw your Cookie preferences at any time by (i) clicking the Cookie Preferences button in our Cookie Policy, (ii) changing your browser controls, or (iii) enabling an authorized browser signal such as the Global Privacy Control. Disabling non-essential Cookies will not affect core functionality but may limit analytics-based improvements. Cookie-derived identifiers are retained only for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes above and never longer than thirteen (13) months for analytics cookies after which they are deleted or irreversibly anonymized.\n\nInformation Security and Accuracy: Lovable is committed to protecting your personal information and maintaining its accuracy. We implement reasonable industry standard safeguards, including:\nData in Transit: All traffic between your browser or API client and our servers is protected with industry standard end-to-end encryption.\nData Storage: Database encryption with secure key management and pseudonymize or anonymize data, where feasible.\nAccess Controls: Role-based access, multi-factor authentication, and regular reviews to ensure only authorized staff can view your data.\nSystem Resilience: Continuous backups with industry-standard recovery objectives designed to minimize downtime and data loss.\nSecurity Monitoring: Real-time monitoring, centralized logging with one-year retention, and annual SOC 2 Type II audits.\nPhysical Security: Data is hosted in SOC 2- and ISO 27001-certified data centers with 24/7 guards, biometric access, CCTV, and environmental safeguards.\nStaff & Vendor Oversight : All employees pass background checks, sign confidentiality agreements, and receive yearly security training; sub-processors are vetted and contractually bound to equivalent protections.\nIncident Response: We maintain a 24/7 incident-response team and will notify affected customers within 72 hours of confirming any notifiable breach.\nYour Role: Please keep your account credentials confidential, enable multi-factor authentication, and let us know if any of your information is incorrect so we can update it.\nLovable keeps a record of processing activities in line with GDPR Article 30(2) and performs regular risk assessments to adapt these measures as threats evolve. If you believe your account information is inaccurate, contact us as set out in Section 16 and we will correct it promptly. We implement reasonable security measures (e.g., encryption in transit/rest, access controls) to protect your personal data, but our Services rely on third-party providers like Supabase (for Lovable Cloud), OpenAI, Google, and OpenRouter (for AI Gateway). We cannot guarantee uninterrupted availability, security, or performance of these providers, and data interruptions, delays, or losses may occur due to their actions or events beyond our control (including force majeure). For Lovable Cloud, certain provisioned resources may not be immediately terminable via API; you remain responsible for any data hosted there until fully decommissioned. In cases of misuse or abuse (e.g., excessive data uploads causing cost spikes), you agree to indemnify us for related privacy or security claims arising from third-party provider interactions, as detailed in our Terms of Service. We use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of material security incidents involving your data but disclaim liability for third-party failures.\n\nRetention of Your Information: We retain personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy or as required by applicable law, including:\nProviding and improving our Services.\nComplying with legal and regulatory obligations.\nResolving disputes or enforcing agreements. Customer data is retained for up to ninety (90) days, unless required by law, after which it is deleted or isolated. To cancel your account or request data deletion, contact us as outlined in Section 16. Upon account termination or expiration (including forfeiture of unused Credits as per the Terms), we will delete your Personal Data within 30 days, except for data required for fraud prevention, legal compliance, or legal defense purposes. Backups may retain data for up to 90 days. To request deletion, contact us at privacy@lovable.dev; we comply with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR erasure rights). We retain Customer Data only as needed to provide the Services, with deletion available upon request (subject to backups and legal holds).\nLinks to Other Sites: Our Services may include links or integrations (for example, GitHub, Supabase, CI/CD tools, or payment providers) that are not controlled by Lovable. Your interactions with those third-party services are governed by their own privacy policies and terms. We encourage you to review those policies before providing personal data, as Lovable is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of external sites.\n\nNotice and Communications: By using the Services, you consent to receive transactional or administrative electronic communications from Lovable\u2014such as account alerts, security notifications, and billing messages. You may opt out of non-essential marketing e-mails at any time via the \"unsubscribe\" link or your account settings; this will not affect core service communications. To send formal privacy notices to Lovable, e-mail privacy@lovable.dev or post to the address in Section 16. Lovable may provide legal or privacy notices to you via e-mail, in-product banners, or any other method allowed by law.\n\nGoverning Law & Venue: This Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. However, if you are located in a jurisdiction that grants you mandatory consumer protection or data protection rights under local law, those provisions will take precedence to the extent they conflict with this Policy. For residents of the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), or Switzerland, international data transfers are subject to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses governed by Irish law with the courts of Dublin as the chosen forum, the UK International Data Transfer Addendum governed by the laws of England and Wales with the courts of London as forum, and the Swiss Addendum governed by Swiss law with the FDPIC as the competent authority. Any other disputes arising under this Policy shall be exclusively resolved in the state or federal courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, unless otherwise required by applicable mandatory law. We disclaim warranties on data accuracy/security in AI outputs or third-party services. See Terms for IP ownership (you own Customer Data/AI Output; we own Usage Data).\n\nNo Coding Advice: Our Services provide AI-assisted tools that can generate or suggest code, but they are not a substitute for professional software engineering judgment. You remain responsible for reviewing, testing, and validating any code or configuration produced by the platform. Reliance on generated output is at your own risk. Intellectual-property ownership, license terms, and usage restrictions are detailed in the \"Intellectual Property Rights\" section of our Terms of Service ( https://www.lovable.dev/terms).\n\nContact Details: If you have questions, concerns, or wish to exercise your privacy rights, please contact us:\n\nEmail: privacy@lovable.dev\nMail: Lovable Labs Incorporated, Attn: Privacy, 1111b South Governors Avenue, Dover, DE 19904, USA\nEU Mail: Lovable Labs Sweden AB, Tunnelgatan 5, 11137 Stockholm, Sweden\nData Protection Officer: dpo@lovable.dev\nWe aim to respond to verified data-subject requests within thirty (30) days, or longer where permitted under applicable law, in which case we will notify you of the delay and reason.

For example,\nSecurity Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And,\ndepending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you\u2019ve\nalready installed and videos you\u2019ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might\nlike.\nDepending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your\ninterests and activity across Google services.

And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your\nrelated Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their\nad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.

For\nexample, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt\nto sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.

Pursuant to our instructions, these parties will access, process, or store Personal Data only in the course of performing their duties to us.\nBusiness Transfers: If we are involved in strategic transactions, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, or transition of service to another provider (collectively, a \u201cTransaction\u201d), your Personal Data may be disclosed in the diligence process with counterparties and others assisting with the Transaction and transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that Transaction along with other assets.\nGovernment Authorities or Other Third Parties: We may share your Personal Data, including information about your interaction with our Services, with government authorities, industry peers, or other third parties in compliance with the law (i) if required to do so to comply with a legal obligation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, (ii) to protect and defend our rights or property, (iii) if we determine, in our sole discretion, that there is a violation of our terms, policies, or the law; (iv) to detect or prevent fraud or other illegal activity; (v) to protect the safety, security, and integrity of our products, employees, users, or the public, or (vi) to protect against legal liability.\nAffiliates: We may disclose Personal Data to our affiliates, meaning an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with OpenAI. Our affiliates may use this Personal Data in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.\nBusiness Account Administrators: When you join a ChatGPT Enterprise or business account, the administrators of that account may access and control your OpenAI account, including being able to access your Content. In addition, if you create an account using an email address belonging to your employer or another organization, we may share the fact that you have an account and certain account information, such as your email address, with your employer or organization to, for example, enable you to be added to their business account.\nOther Users and Third Parties You Interact or Share Information With: Certain features allow you to interact or share information with other users or third parties. For example, you can share ChatGPT conversations with other users via shared links\u2060(opens in a new window). You can also send information to third-party applications, such as via custom actions for GPTs, or for searching the web to help answer questions that benefit from more recent information. Information you share with third parties is governed by their own terms and privacy policies, and you should make sure you understand those terms and policies before sharing information with them.\n5. Retention\nWe\u2019ll retain your Personal Data for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons, or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Data will depend on a number of factors, such as:\n\nOur purpose for processing the data (such as whether we need to retain the data to provide our Services);\nThe amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data;\nThe potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the data;\nAny legal requirements that we are subject to.\nIn some cases, the length of time we retain data depends on your settings. For example, ChatGPT\u2019s data controls offer you the ability to turn off chat history. When chat history is disabled, the conversation will not appear in your history and we will permanently delete new conversations after 30 days and review them only as needed to monitor for and investigate abuse. You can find more information on data controls here\u2060(opens in a new window).\n\n6. Your rights\nYou have the following statutory rights in relation to your Personal Data:\n\nAccess your Personal Data and information relating to how it is processed.\nDelete your Personal Data from our records.\nRectify or update your Personal Data.\nTransfer your Personal Data to a third party (right to data portability).\nRestrict how we process your Personal Data.\nWithdraw your consent\u2014where we rely on consent as the legal basis for processing at any time.\nLodge a complaint with your local data protection authority (see below).\nYou have the following rights to object:\n\nObject to our processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing at any time.\nObject to how we process your Personal Data when our processing is based on legitimate interests.\nYou can exercise some of these rights through your OpenAI account.

For any unresolved complaints relating to the UK you can reach out to the Information Commissioner's Office\u2060(opens in a new window) and for Switzerland, to the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner\u2060(opens in a new window).\n\nA note about accuracy: Services like ChatGPT generate responses by reading a user\u2019s request and, in response, predicting the words most likely to appear next. In some cases, the words most likely to appear next may not be the most factually accurate. For this reason, you should not rely on the factual accuracy of output from our models. If you notice that ChatGPT output contains factually inaccurate information about you and you would like to request a correction or removal of the information, you can submit these requests through privacy.openai.com or to dsar@openai.com\u2060, and we will consider your request based on applicable law and the technical capabilities of our models.\n\nFor information on how to exercise your rights with respect to data we have collected from the internet to train our models, please see this notice\u2060(opens in a new window).\n\n7.

Anyone who hasn\u2019t been added to a design will need to request access from you. This is the most private sharing option, and Canva uses this as the default setting for all designs .\n\n2. \u201cAnyone with the link\u201d: Anyone on the internet who has the link can access your design (and view or edit if you select this).

For example, you may install a third-party document sharing app in order to store, share and edit content through our Service.

In that situation, Canva determines the target audience and Canva serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.\n\nThe Canva Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers.

For the purposes of the Canva Education product, a \u201cStudent\u201d means an individual enrolled in a K-12 school (or primary or secondary school for countries who do not use the K-12 designation) invited to use Canva Education by a Teacher or administrator. Canva's collection of student data is authorized by participating educational institutions obtaining parental consent or providing consent on behalf of the parent, if applicable, or as a proxy for the parent in certain circumstances. We will share student data with our third party service providers who have security, privacy, and data retention policies consistent with our policies and solely to the extent necessary for them to perform a business or technology support function for us. This may include data processing, account management or providing us with usage analytics. Canva does not sell student data.\n\nThe following third party service providers will process student data for the sole purpose of delivering the Canva Education service. If a school deletes their Canva Education account, or requests the deletion of personally identifiable information associated with a student\u2019s account, Canva will direct these services to delete any such information they hold:\n\nProvider (Purpose)\n\nAmazon Web Services (data storage, service emails)\nAmplitude (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)\nAtlassian (user support)\nAda (chatbot for user support)\nAppbot (user support)\nBraze (email communications)\nCanva Solutions, Inc.

If the student does not log in to their account within 3 months following the receipt of that email, we will delete that account.\n\nUpon termination of a school\u2019s Canva Education account, we will delete all student accounts associated with that school.\n\nEducational institutions will have direct control of student data at all times. If an educational institution wishes to inspect, review, amend or delete data we have collected from a student, they may submit an authorised request to privacy@canva.com or to any of the contact details provided in section 14 below. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the Canva Education account. To protect children\u2019s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the educational institution\u2019s identity before granting access to any personal information.\n\nIf you are part of a Canva Education Team, whether this is at a classroom or school level(\u201cSchool Team\u201d),the educational institution your Team is employed by or part of(\u201cDistrict Team\u201d), may request to add your School Team to its District Team. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the District. To protect children\u2019s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the district's identity and relationship to the School Team before granting access to any personal information. If your Team is added to a District Team, then any information or content that you created in the School Team or activity you have taken within the School may be shared with the Team Owner of the District. If requested by the Team Owner of the District, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the School Team to District Team. You should ensure that any personal information, intellectual property or confidential information that you\u2019d like to maintain ownership over is retained or moved to a separate personal account with an email address not issued by your employer.\n\nCanva and its service providers may communicate directly with students for technical support purposes where requested by the student or their teacher. Canva may also send emails in relation to product changes, privacy changes and other service-related emails to students and teachers.\n\nStudents may use Canva Sites (as defined in our Terms of Use) if the functionality is enabled by their teacher, school or school district. These will not be indexed by search engines by default, meaning that they cannot be found by Google or another browser search and could only be accessed by people with the specific link. However, this default can be switched off by teachers so that the sites are indexed by search engines.\n\nAll designs in a Canva Education account are private by default so that only people specifically added to the design, can access it, except where an educational institution that owns the account requests access (e.g., for security and/or incident investigation purposes). A student may make their design public so that anyone with the link can access, view or edit it. But it will only be accessible to anonymous, non-logged in users if a teacher turns on anonymous collaboration (which is switched off by default). This might occur to facilitate collaboration with students that are not registered with Canva or have forgotten their password. This will allow them to view or edit a design.\n\n\n\n(U.S. only): Canva Education has been certified compliant with the Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by iKeepSafe.

Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party\u2019s own rules and policies.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.\n\nSummary: If we post a link to a third party website on Canva, we can\u2019t control what happens on the other end. The same applies if you let another site use your data on Canva; the use of your information will be governed by the Privacy Policy of the third party.\n\n11.

If you have questions or concerns about how your personal data is handled by one of our customers, you should contact the relevant customer that is using our Service and refer to their separate privacy policies.\n\n(b) Legal bases for processing\n\nIf you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, we need a lawful basis to collect, use and disclose your personal data as a controller.

We may transfer your personal data to other countries where our affiliates and service providers are located. Please note that some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). For Canva users in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, where we transfer your information to a third-party service provider that is not located in Europe, and is not in a country that benefits from an adequacy decision by the European Commission, UK or Swiss authorities, we will require those third party providers to enter into an agreement that provides appropriate safeguards for your information, including by using the EU Model Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum.\n\n\n\nSummary: If you are accessing our Service from Europe, Canva Pty Ltd is the controller of your personal data. In some cases, though, we may only be processing your information on behalf of a Team as a processor. We only process your data if we have a lawful basis.

        "Apple_intelligence_privacy_policy.txt": "Apple Intelligence is a system of generative AI features that are specialized to help you with your everyday tasks. Apple Intelligence can help you rewrite or proofread your emails or notes, summarize your missed messages, create custom memories in Photos, generate images, and more. Apple Intelligence is designed to deliver personal intelligence without Apple collecting your personal data.\n\nTo provide a customized experience, Apple Intelligence uses information on your device including across your apps, like your upcoming calendar events and your frequently used apps. Apple Intelligence identifies the data necessary to provide to a generative model in order to best assist you, without requiring access to or storage of the data by Apple.\n\nWhen possible, Apple Intelligence models run entirely on device so that a task can be completed without data leaving your device. For example, when Apple Intelligence provides you with preview summaries of your emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models. There are times, however, when Apple Intelligence needs to leverage a model that requires more computational power than your device can provide on its own. For these tasks, Apple Intelligence sends your request to Private Cloud Compute. Private Cloud Compute is a server-based intelligence system designed to handle more complex requests while protecting your privacy. For example, when you use Writing Tools to proofread or edit an email, your device may send the email to Private Cloud Compute for a server-based model to do the proofreading or editing.\n\nWhen you initiate an Apple Intelligence task, a model running on your device analyzes whether the task can be completed on device. If a larger, server-based model is required, Apple Intelligence uses Private Cloud Compute to send only data relevant to your request to be processed on Apple silicon servers. The data sent to and returned by Private Cloud Compute is not stored or made accessible to Apple. The data is processed only to fulfill your request, after which point the results are returned securely to your device and are not retained by Private Cloud Compute. When your device sends a request to Private Cloud Compute, Apple only collects limited information about the request, such as the approximate size of the request and response, which features are used for the request, and how long the request takes to complete. This data does not include any information about the content of your request or the returned result. It is not identifiable or linked to your Apple Account or other data Apple may have from your use of other Apple services.\n\nYou can turn on transparency logging for Apple Intelligence on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device to see how your data is processed by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report, then selecting a report duration. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report, then select a report duration. After requests are made, you can export a file. This transparency logging will show requests sent off your device and processed by Private Cloud Compute, including requests originating from watchOS. Additionally, if you enable the ChatGPT extension, it will include requests sent to ChatGPT when used with supported features, like Siri, Writing Tools, or Visual Intelligence.\n\nIf you have chosen to opt in to share Device Analytics with Apple, Apple may use privacy-preserving techniques to collect data about aggregated trends, including about the content processed by Apple Intelligence, in order to improve Apple Intelligence. As a result of these protections, Apple can use this data to understand how to improve Apple Intelligence features without collecting individual user data or content. You can disable the sharing of Device Analytics data at any time on your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device by going to Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and turning off Share [Device] Analytics. On Mac, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Analytics & Improvements, and turn off Share Mac Analytics."
