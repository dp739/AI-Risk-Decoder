TERMS OF USE
Last Modified: 12/12/2024

Welcome to the IRIS Dating Service! The IRIS Service is comprised of both an App and a Website (collectively, the "Service") that allow you to use the Service, post information, and interact with other members. The IRIS Service is provided by Ideal Match, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which will be referred to as "IRIS."

These Terms of Use ("Terms") and the IRIS Privacy Policy govern your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

Changes to the Terms of Use

Purchases and Subscriptions

You have the opportunity to buy a subscription to IRIS premium, an upgraded version of IRIS. You may also purchase certain IRIS products that may enhance your Service experience.  You may purchase a subscription to IRIS premium or an IRIS product through the following payment methods: (a) by paying through a Third-Party Store such as the Apple App Store, Google Play or any other mobile or web application platforms we authorize, or (b) by paying with your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account, which will be processed by our third-party payment processor. You agree to pay sales and other taxes that may now or in the future be determined to apply to the services you receive.

Once you have selected your chosen service and/or product, you authorize us to charge you via your chosen payment method and your payment is non-refundable. IRIS premium subscriptions automatically renew until you cancel.

Please note, some Third-Party Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase the IRIS premium subscription, your third-party service account will continue to be periodically charged for the subscription until you cancel. To cancel a subscription you purchased through a Third-Party Store, you must log in to your third-party service account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your IRIS account or even deleted the IRIS mobile app from your device.

If you make a purchase through our Service using our third-party payment processor, please note our payment processor and your card issuer may perform validation checks on online transactions and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our payment processor uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. If you purchased an IRIS premium subscription through our Service, our third-party payment processor will periodically charge your chosen payment method until you cancel your subscription. To cancel your subscription, please log into the Service and go to Your Account. You can continue to use your cancelled IRIS premium subscription until the end of your subscription term, but it will not automatically renew thereafter.

For customers in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin who purchase IRIS premium subscriptions, you have a Right to Cancel. This means you may cancel your subscription, without penalty or obligation, any time prior to midnight of the third business day following the date you subscribed. Additionally, although IRIS is available throughout the United States, if you believe you moved into an area outside our services, you may cancel your subscription and receive a refund. If this applies to you and you wish to cancel your subscription, please contact our Customer Service team at the email address listed at the end of this agreement. If you purchased the subscription through a Third-Party Store, please contact their customer support teams for assistance instead.

For IRIS premium subscribers in New York, you can review the New York Dating Service Consumer Bill of Rights at the New York State Attorney General’s website. Please note, IRIS does not guarantee any number of “social referrals,” rather users view the profiles of others without restriction. 

For IRIS premium subscribers in North Carolina, you can review the North Carolina Buyer’s Rights at the North Carolina Department of Justice website.

Monitoring and Enforcement; Termination

We have the right to:

Remove or refuse to post any user posting for any or no reason in our sole discretion.

Take any action with respect to any user posting that we deem necessary or appropriate in our sole discretion, including if we believe that such user posting violates the Acceptable Use Policy, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Service or the public, contains harassing, insulting or degrading materials, or could create liability for IRIS.

Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.

Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Service.

Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Service for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Use.

Without limiting the foregoing, we have the right to cooperate fully with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing us to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Service. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD IRIS AND ITS LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS HARMLESS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY IRIS OR ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING, OR TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF, INVESTIGATIONS BY ANY SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

However, we cannot review all material before it is posted on the Service and cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications, or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.

Safety, Security, and Courtesy

While IRIS employs selfie verification technology to enhance user authenticity, it cannot guarantee the identity or intentions of any user. Users should exercise caution when interacting with others online and be particularly vigilant when deciding to meet in person. IRIS encourages users to report suspicious or inappropriate behavior and provides tools to block or report users.

IRIS does not vet, endorse, check out or verify the background, intentions or character of any of its users. You should use common sense and reasonable safety and security precautions with regard to anyone you choose to contact or meet pursuant to the IRIS Service.  The information presented on or through the Service is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk.

IRIS DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND OR IDENTITY VERIFICATION CHECKS ON ITS USERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUND OF ITS USERS. IRIS MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS TO THE CONDUCT, IDENTITY, INTENTIONS, LEGITIMACY OR VERACITY OF USERS. 

HOWEVER, IRIS RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT—AND YOU AUTHORIZE IRIS TO CONDUCT—ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS, AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. IF IRIS DECIDES TO CONDUCT ANY SCREENING THROUGH A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, YOU HEREBY AUTHORIZE IRIS TO OBTAIN AND USE A CONSUMER REPORT ABOUT YOU TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY UNDER THESE TERMS.

Though IRIS strives to encourage a respectful user experience, it is not responsible for the conduct of any user on or off the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person.

Governing Law and Jurisdiction

All matters relating to the Website and these Terms of Use and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction).

Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these Terms of Use or the Website shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of New York although we retain the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these Terms of Use in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to venue in such courts.

Arbitration

At Company's sole discretion, it may require You to submit any disputes arising from the use of these Terms of Use or the Website, including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, to final and binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association applying New York law.

By using the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend any claims between you and IRIS. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING.

You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. 

Limitation on Time to File Claims

Waiver and Severability

No waiver by IRIS of any term or condition set out in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of IRIS to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.

Entire Agreement

The Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Ideal Match, Inc. regarding the Service and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Service.
