What does this policy cover

Welcome to Canva. Our Privacy Policy explains how the Canva Contracting Entity (as defined in the Terms of Use) (“Canva”, “we” or “us”) and its affiliates collect, use, disclose, and protect information when you use Canva’s services (the "Service") or interact with us, and your choices about the collection and use of your information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use. If you do not want your information processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our Service. This policy applies to all users of the Service, including, but not limited to users of our Developer Portal.

Summary: Welcome, here is our policy on privacy. This policy sets out how Canva and affiliates like Affinity collect and use the information that we collect about you when you use the Service. This policy also explains the choices that you can make about the way that we use your information.

1. Information we collect

We collect the following types of information about you:

(a) Information you provide us directly

We may ask for certain information when you register for a Canva account or interact with us (such as a username, your first and last names, birthdate, phone number, profession, physical and e-mail address).

We also collect any messages you send us through the Service (such as user feedback, search queries and prompts), and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service (such as text and photos you upload to use in your designs). We use this information to operate, maintain, improve and provide the features and functionality of the Service to you, to correspond with you, and to address any issues you raise about the Service.

If you don’t provide your personal information to us, you may not be able to access or use our Service or your experience of using our Service may not be as enjoyable.



Summary: We collect info about you that you choose to give us, for example when you register an account, use the Service or otherwise interact with us.

(b) Information we receive from third-party applications or services

We may receive information about you from third parties or Canva affiliates. For example, if you access the Service through a third-party connection or log-in, such as Facebook Connect, by “following,” “liking,” adding the Canva application, linking your account to the Canva Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to Canva. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will no longer receive information collected about you in connection with that service. And if you choose to integrate with a third party application to incorporate elements into your designs, enhance media, supercharge your workflow or share to social media, we could receive data from such apps (as well as disclose data to such apps). If you communicate with us via social media, including Instagram, Facebook or TikTok and choose to share your user generated content with us, we may receive information such as videos you’ve created, your photo, your account name and your comments about Canva.

We may share your email address or other information in order to obtain and combine this information with information that you provide to us or other information that we collect when you use our Service. We do this to better understand your profile and interests so that we can deliver customized offers and other personalized services to you, such as to serve relevant offers to you via email, chatbots, phone or personalized advertising. You can opt out of Canva collecting more data about you from third-party providers to tailor your experience and messages we send you here.

Some of these providers may combine data collected from our Service through cookies, pixels, tags and similar technologies, with email or mailing addresses to which they have access to help us serve relevant offers to you.

If you are not a Canva subscriber, we may obtain your contact details from a social media platform, such as LinkedIn, or a third party data provider, so that we can promote our product offerings and subscriptions to you if we think they would be helpful in your role.

We may also receive information about you and your engagement with our advertisements from our ad servers, ad networks and social media platforms. This may include the websites you visited before coming to Canva so that we can determine advertising effectiveness and pay our referral partners.

Summary: We might share some information about you with our affiliates, business partners and third-party service providers in order to provide the Service to you or to fulfill Canva’s legitimate business interests.

(b) How you can share your User Content

(i) Public Posts

Any information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service, such as public User Content, becomes available to be read, collected and used by the public. When you set your profile to public, or make User Content public, your information becomes publicly available globally, searchable by other users and can be indexed by search engines. If you or Canva remove information that you posted to the Service, copies remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other users have copied or saved that information.

You may share your Canva designs to your social media accounts, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and Tumblr. You should ensure that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of each of these services and any privacy settings that may apply to the designs you choose to share on those accounts.

(ii) Teams

If you are part of a Team, then any information or content that you create in, or share to, that Team or activity you take within the Team may be shared with other Team members and the Team Owner. If requested by the Team Owner, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the Team to the Team Owner or to another Team member. The Team Owner or any Team Administrator in your Team may also move, delete or edit any folders or items you share with them, or the Team.You should ensure that any personal information, confidential information, or User Content that you’d like to keep private is retained in a separate personal account.

(iii) Design Collaboration

If you accept an invite to view, edit, collaborate on or interact with a Canva design then, subject to your privacy settings, we may share certain information about your interaction with that design with the design owner and other users who have access to that design, including the following:

your name and avatar will be visible to anyone else in the design at the same time as you, whether or not they are logged in to Canva or anonymous and your email will also be visible to anyone logged in to Canva who is part of your Team;
your name, avatar and interactions (e.g. comments, reactions, responses or answers to interactive functionality) will be visible to any other person that also has edit access to that design, and (depending on the settings chosen by the design owner) may also be visible to anyone else viewing the design; and
your name, avatar, email and usage metrics, including time of access and related insights about how you interact with the design, will become available to any other person that has edit access to that design, including the designer owner, whether or not they are within your Team.
While your name and avatar will remain visible to anyone that has access to a design, you can make your email and usage metrics anonymous by turning the 'Share my design usage with collaborators' toggle off in your privacy settings.

As the owner or editor of an individual design, you can choose to give other people access to your designs using the following link sharing settings:

1. “Only people added can access”: Only people who have been added to those designs via their email or Canva account will have access to your design. Anyone who hasn’t been added to a design will need to request access from you. This is the most private sharing option, and Canva uses this as the default setting for all designs .

2. “Anyone with the link”: Anyone on the internet who has the link can access your design (and view or edit if you select this). We do not recommend this option for information you wish to keep confidential. Please note that this setting will, by default (except for Canva Education subscriptions) also allow non-Canva users to anonymously access your design (and view the full names, avatars, cursors and comments of logged in users).

3. “Only your team*”: Only people on your team that have the link can access, view or edit (as you select) your design. This means if you share the link on an email or Slack communication with numerous people in your Team, any of them can access the design without further permission. *Subject to being made available for your team.

Canva collects your links and they may be shared with service providers where required to provide the Services. Once you share a link, it may be on-shared by your recipients.



Summary: Our designs are private by default. When sharing and interacting with designs, make sure the privacy settings are appropriate. For designs with personal or confidential information, we don’t recommend "anyone with the link" setting.

(c) Sharing in connection with a merger, acquisition or reorganization

Canva may also share, sell or transfer your information to third parties in connection with or contemplation of (including as part of the due diligence process) any merger, acquisition, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, bankruptcy or insolvency event involving Canva or any portion of our assets, services or businesses. Information such as customer names and email addresses, User Content and other user information related to the Service may be among the items shared, sold or otherwise transferred in these types of transactions. You will be notified via email and/or a notice on the Service if such a transaction takes place and be given notice of any material changes to the way we handle your data under this policy.

Summary: If we sell our business, any of the info which we’ve acquired about you may be part of the sale.

If you sign up for the Service using an email address associated with your employer or another organization (“Admin Entity”), this Canva account will be an “Administered Account” and Canva may:

share your name, email address, and account activity information with the Admin Entity; and
give control of the Administered Account to the Admin Entity.
If your Administered Account is controlled by an Admin Entity, the Admin Entity’s admin may access, transfer and control your Administered Account and all content and designs associated with it, as well as:

make changes to the Administered Account and billing settings and privacy preferences;
make changes to the folder permissions; and
delete the Administered Account.
Where an Admin Entity has requested control of an existing Administered Account, Canva will provide you with advance notice so that you can transfer your content and designs to a personal Canva account (subject to you providing us with a valid email address) before your Admin Entity receives control over the Administered Account.



Summary: Where you use a work or managed email to set up an account, we might share information about the account with your employer or organization associated with the email address they manage and we might transfer control of the account to them.

(e) Sharing with other third parties

Canva will also share your information with third parties in certain circumstances, such as where you consent to our sharing it with a third party for a particular purpose.

You or your account administrator may also choose to work with third-party products integrated into Canva or third-party applications (listed here) from within Canva so that you can incorporate elements into your designs (e.g., YouTube, an application that uses the YouTube API Services and users agree to be bound by the YouTube Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy, and Google Drive), enhance your media (e.g., with duotone and shadows) or supercharge your workflow (e.g., with LinkedIn or Slack). For example, you may install a third-party document sharing app in order to store, share and edit content through our Service. Using third party-products or integrating with third party applications could involve importing data from that third party to Canva and/or exporting data from Canva to that third party. If this requires connecting your Canva account to your account on the third party application, you will be asked for permission. For the YouTube application, you can revoke Canva’s YouTube application’s access to your data via the Google security settings page at https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.

These third-party products and apps are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. You should review the terms and conditions of any third party apps before connecting them to the Service. If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, do not use the product or install the app.

4. Advertising

We partner with third party ad servers, ad networks and social media platforms (like Facebook, Google, LiveRamp, Outbrain, Taboola and Appsflyer) to deliver personalized advertisements (“ads”) on our Service and other sites that may be of interest to you and/or to measure their effectiveness, and/or to identify potential new users of our Service.

Canva may share certain information with our third party advertising partners, such as your email address, location, cookie information and information relating to your use of our Service, and allow partners to perform a match of your information against information from other third party networks or sites to serve ads either on the Service or on third party sites (including, but not limited to Facebook, Google and Samsung televisions) and to measure the effectiveness of these ads. We also share certain information with social media platforms, such as Facebook and Tiktok, to display advertising to potential new users whose demographics and behaviour look like those of our existing users. You can opt out of having your email matched by Liveramp here or by emailing privacy@canva.com.

In addition, these third-party ad servers or ad networks may use technology to send, directly to your browser or mobile device, these personalized ads and ad links directly to your browser or mobile device, and will automatically receive your IP address when they do so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, device identifiers, location data, and clear gifs) to compile information about your browser’s or device’s visits and usage patterns on the Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize the advertising content. Please see our Cookies Policy for more information about how we and our third party partners use cookies and other technologies to deliver ads to you.

Canva does not sell or rent the information we collect directly from you or about you from third parties with these third-party ad servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing purposes.

Please note that an advertiser may ask Canva to show an ad on the Service to a certain audience of users (e.g., based on demographics or other interests). In that situation, Canva determines the target audience and Canva serves the advertising to that audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach.

The Canva Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party advertisers. Please consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers or contact such advertisers for more information.

Canva Education: Please note that this Section 4 does not apply to students using Canva Education – we do not serve advertising to students using Canva Education.

Summary: If we have ads on our site we might use some of your info to show you appropriate ads. We may also use some of that info to send you relevant ads on other sites, like Facebook or Google.

5. How we transfer, store and protect your data

Your information collected through the Service will be stored and processed in the United States, Australia, Singapore, European Union, United Kingdom, Philippines and New Zealand and any other country in which Canva or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities or employ staff or contractors. Canva transfers information that we collect about you, including personal information, to affiliated entities, and to other third parties across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. As a result, we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. However, we always take steps to ensure that your information remains protected wherever it is stored and processed in accordance with applicable laws. Where required under applicable laws, you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Canva or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

Canva’s U.S. subsidiary adheres to compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. You can learn more about these frameworks, including your rights under each program, in our Data Privacy Framework Statement.

Summary: To run our Service, we’ll have to use our Canva group members and vendors around the world. This means your information might be transferred to the U.S., Australia, Europe, Singapore, Philippines, New Zealand and anywhere else the Service is operated.

6. Keeping your information safe

Canva cares about the security of your information, and uses appropriate safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Canva, at all times. However, Canva cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Canva or guarantee that information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed. Your privacy settings may also be affected by changes to the functionality of third party sites and services that you add to the Canva Service, such as social networks. Canva is not responsible for the functionality or security measures of any third party.

For example, we may not be able to provide a copy of your information where it infringes on the rights of another user. In some cases, you may have shared your information with third parties, such as by publishing a design on a third party’s website. In that case Canva will not be able to delete the information, and you will need to contact that third party directly.

If we are unable to resolve your request, or if you are concerned about a potential violation, you also have the option to report the issue or make a complaint to the data protection authority in your jurisdiction. Where you have provided your consent to certain processing and no longer want us to use your information for that purpose, you may withdraw your consent to this use, although this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Please see paragraph “You control your account information and settings” for more options on how to opt-out of marketing communications.

Summary: You may have specific rights in relation to your information depending on where you live. Canva provides you with a number of controls in Your Account settings and you can access your privacy rights by emailing privacy@canva.com.

8. How long we keep your information

Following termination or deactivation of your user account, Canva will retain your profile information and User Content for a commercially reasonable time, and for as long as we have a valid purpose to do so. In particular, Canva will retain your information for the purpose of complying with its legal and audit obligations, and for backup and archival purposes.

Summary: We retain your profile information and user content for the purpose of providing our Service to you and to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations.

9. Canva Education

In this policy, a child is considered a person under the age of 13 years old (or the minimum legal age in the child’s country to be able to provide lawful consent to the processing of their personal data where the age is higher than 13 years old).

The Service and our content are not directed at children. Children are not permitted to sign up by themselves for the Service.

Other than as part of Canva Education (set out below), Canva does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent where this is required, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at privacy@canva.com.

Canva Education: Children who are students may use our Canva Education service under the supervision of their teacher. For the purposes of the Canva Education product, a “Student” means an individual enrolled in a K-12 school (or primary or secondary school for countries who do not use the K-12 designation) invited to use Canva Education by a Teacher or administrator. Canva's collection of student data is authorized by participating educational institutions obtaining parental consent or providing consent on behalf of the parent, if applicable, or as a proxy for the parent in certain circumstances. We will share student data with our third party service providers who have security, privacy, and data retention policies consistent with our policies and solely to the extent necessary for them to perform a business or technology support function for us. This may include data processing, account management or providing us with usage analytics. Canva does not sell student data.

The following third party service providers will process student data for the sole purpose of delivering the Canva Education service. If a school deletes their Canva Education account, or requests the deletion of personally identifiable information associated with a student’s account, Canva will direct these services to delete any such information they hold:

Provider (Purpose)

Amazon Web Services (data storage, service emails)
Amplitude (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Atlassian (user support)
Ada (chatbot for user support)
Appbot (user support)
Braze (email communications)
Canva Solutions, Inc. (user support)
Concentrix (user support)
Elastic (data logging)
Jira (user support)
Loggly (logging)
Looker (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
Mode (Analysis of aggregated user behaviour data)
MongoDB (Atlas) (data storage)
Sentry (error monitoring)
Serif (Europe) Limited (Affinity Software (as defined in the Affinity Additional Terms) and user support)
SheerID (teacher verification)
Slack (platform support)
Snowflake (data storage)
Zendesk (user support)
OpenAI (Canva AI products)
Annually, at or around the end of the school year, if a student account has not been logged into by a student for more than 12 months, we will send an email to the email address associated with that account to notify the student that their account will be deleted unless they log into such account. If the student does not log in to their account within 3 months following the receipt of that email, we will delete that account.

Upon termination of a school’s Canva Education account, we will delete all student accounts associated with that school.

Educational institutions will have direct control of student data at all times. If an educational institution wishes to inspect, review, amend or delete data we have collected from a student, they may submit an authorised request to privacy@canva.com or to any of the contact details provided in section 14 below. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the Canva Education account. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the educational institution’s identity before granting access to any personal information.

If you are part of a Canva Education Team, whether this is at a classroom or school level(“School Team”),the educational institution your Team is employed by or part of(“District Team”), may request to add your School Team to its District Team. Such a request must come from the email address that owns or is the Team Owner of the District. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify the district's identity and relationship to the School Team before granting access to any personal information. If your Team is added to a District Team, then any information or content that you created in the School Team or activity you have taken within the School may be shared with the Team Owner of the District. If requested by the Team Owner of the District, Canva may re-assign ownership of any User Content you post in the School Team to District Team. You should ensure that any personal information, intellectual property or confidential information that you’d like to maintain ownership over is retained or moved to a separate personal account with an email address not issued by your employer.

Canva and its service providers may communicate directly with students for technical support purposes where requested by the student or their teacher. Canva may also send emails in relation to product changes, privacy changes and other service-related emails to students and teachers.

Students may use Canva Sites (as defined in our Terms of Use) if the functionality is enabled by their teacher, school or school district. These will not be indexed by search engines by default, meaning that they cannot be found by Google or another browser search and could only be accessed by people with the specific link. However, this default can be switched off by teachers so that the sites are indexed by search engines.

All designs in a Canva Education account are private by default so that only people specifically added to the design, can access it, except where an educational institution that owns the account requests access (e.g., for security and/or incident investigation purposes). A student may make their design public so that anyone with the link can access, view or edit it. But it will only be accessible to anonymous, non-logged in users if a teacher turns on anonymous collaboration (which is switched off by default). This might occur to facilitate collaboration with students that are not registered with Canva or have forgotten their password. This will allow them to view or edit a design.



(U.S. only): Canva Education has been certified compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) by iKeepSafe. Teachers and parents may contact us on +1 855 228 9195 (toll free) with inquiries concerning our Privacy Policy and use of children’s information.

Summary: We’ve created a safe space for children, who are supervised by teachers, to use Canva. Our main Service at canva.com is not intended for children.

10. Links to other websites and services

We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites or services linked to or from the Service, including the information or content contained therein. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites or services. Your browsing and interaction on any third-party website or service, including those that have a link or advertisement on our website, are subject to that third party’s own rules and policies. In addition, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for and we do not exercise control over any third parties that you authorize to access your User Content. If you are using a third-party website or service (like Facebook) and you allow such a third party access to your User Content you do so at your own risk. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other means (including offline) or from other sources other than through the Service.

Summary: If we post a link to a third party website on Canva, we can’t control what happens on the other end. The same applies if you let another site use your data on Canva; the use of your information will be governed by the Privacy Policy of the third party.

11. Additional information for users in Europe

This section of the policy applies to Canva users that are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or United Kingdom (UK). Canva processes your personal data in accordance with European laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).

(a) Controller's details

For the purposes of the GDPR and UK GDPR, Canva Pty Ltd is the controller of your personal data. Canva Pty Ltd’s registered address is at 110 Kippax St, Surry Hills, NSW, Australia 2010, and we can be contacted using the details provided in section 14 below. “How to contact us” heading.

In certain circumstances, we process personal data as a processor on behalf of our customer. Canva’s Terms of Use set out the circumstances where Canva processes personal data as a processor. In these cases, it is the Canva customer that is responsible for the processing of your personal data and Canva’s processing will be governed by the terms of the Data Processing Addendum it has entered with the customer. If you have questions or concerns about how your personal data is handled by one of our customers, you should contact the relevant customer that is using our Service and refer to their separate privacy policies.

(b) Legal bases for processing

If you are located in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, we need a lawful basis to collect, use and disclose your personal data as a controller. Our lawful basis will depend on the information concerned and the context in which it is processed.

Generally, Canva will collect and use your information as follows:

Contractual necessity: We need it to provide the Service to you and fulfil our obligations to you under our Terms of Use. For example, this includes creating and maintaining your account, resolving issues you may experience with the Service, obtaining payment for our Services and providing you with access to your designs.
Legitimate interests: It is necessary for our legitimate interests for example, providing a useful and customized Service, sending you relevant marketing messages, displaying advertising and tracking its effectiveness, using information we collect about you (like your spending, platform usage, occupation and employer) so that we can make more informed predictions, decisions and offers for our users, helping users connect with team members and their employer's subscription on Canva and enhancing our Service via research and development, data analytics, data labelling, machine learning and predictive analytics relating to your usage data. We do not rely on this lawful basis where our legitimate interests are overridden by your rights and interests.
Consent: You consent to us, and our third party partners, using your information in a certain way – for example, to hear about new features or offers, and for machine learning and predictive analysis relating to your User Content.
Legal obligations: It is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations – for example, to disclose your information in response to law enforcement requests and to retain your information for our record keeping purposes.
If you consented to our use of your information, you can withdraw that consent at any time. Depending on the situation you can either withdraw your consent by emailing privacy@canva.com, or through your privacy settings page.

Where we use your information for our legitimate interest, you have the right to object to that use by contacting privacy@canva.com. However, if you do, it may diminish the quality of the Service you receive or prevent you from using the Service.

(c) Cross-border transfers of information

By signing up, you understand and agree that Canva Pty Ltd (an entity in Australia) will receive and process your personal data. We may transfer your personal data to other countries where our affiliates and service providers are located. Please note that some of these countries may have data protection laws that are different from your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective). For Canva users in the EEA, Switzerland or UK, where we transfer your information to a third-party service provider that is not located in Europe, and is not in a country that benefits from an adequacy decision by the European Commission, UK or Swiss authorities, we will require those third party providers to enter into an agreement that provides appropriate safeguards for your information, including by using the EU Model Clauses and the UK International Data Transfer Addendum.



Summary: If you are accessing our Service from Europe, Canva Pty Ltd is the controller of your personal data. In some cases, though, we may only be processing your information on behalf of a Team as a processor. We only process your data if we have a lawful basis. We may transfer your information outside of Europe subject to appropriate safeguards.
